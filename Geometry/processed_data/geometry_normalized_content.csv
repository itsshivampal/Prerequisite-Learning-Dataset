1,1,1.1,Basic Geometric Definitions,2,Here youll learn the basic geometric definitions and rules you will need to succeed in geometry. What if you were given picture of figure or an object like map with cities and roads marked on it? How could you explain that picture geometrically? After completing this Concept youll be able to describe such map using geometric terms. Guidance point is an exact location in space. point describes location but has no size. Dots are used to represent points in pictures and diagrams. These points are said Point Point and Point F. Points are labeled with CAPITAL letter. line is set of infinitely many points that extend forever in both directions. line like point does not take up space. It has direction location and is always straight. Lines are one-dimensional because they only have length (no width). line can by named or identified using any two points on that line or with lower-case italicized letter. This line can be labeled PQ QP or just g. You would say line PQ line QP or line respectively. Notice that the line over the PQ and QP has arrows over both the and Q. The order of and does not matter. plane is infinitely many intersecting lines that extend forever in all directions. Think of plane as huge sheet of paper that goes on forever. Planes are considered to be two-dimensional because they have length and width. plane can be classified by any three points in the plane. This plane would be labeled Plane ABC or Plane Again the order of the letters does not matter. We can use point line and plane to define new terms. Space is the set of all points extending in three dimensions. Think back to the plane. It extended along two different lines: up and down and side to side. If we add third direction we have something that looks like three-dimensional space or the real-world. Points that lie on the same line are collinear. and are collinear because they are all on line w. If point were located above or below line it would be non-collinear. Points andor lines within the same plane are coplanar. Lines and and points BC and are coplanar in Plane Line KF and point are non-coplanar with Plane An endpoint is point at the end of line segment. Line segments are labeled by their endpoints AB or BA. Notice that the bar over the endpoints has NO arrows. Order does not matter. ray is part of line with one endpoint that extends forever in the direction opposite that endpoint. ray is labeled by its endpoint and one other point on the line. Of lines line segments and rays rays are the only one where order matters. When labeling always write the endpoint under the side WITHOUT the arrow CD or DC. An intersection is point or set of points where lines planes segments or rays cross each other. Postulates With these new definitions we can make statements and generalizations about these geometric figures. This section introduces few basic postulates. Throughout this course we will be introducing Postulates and Theorems so it is important that you understand what they are and how they differ. Postulates are basic rules of geometry. We can assume that all postulates are true much like definition. Theorems are statements that can be proven true using postulates definitions and other theorems that have already been proven. The only difference between theorem and postulate is that postulate is proven true. We will prove theorems later in this course. Postulate 1: Given any two distinct points there is exactly one (straight) line containing those two points. Postulate 2: Given any three non-collinear points there is exactly one plane containing those three points. Postulate 3: If line and plane share two points then the entire line lies within the plane. Postulate 4: If two distinct lines intersect the intersection will be one point. Postulate 5: If two distinct planes intersect the intersection will be line.

2,2,1.2,Distance Between Two Points,10,Here youll learn how to measure using ruler how to add segments and how to place line segments on coordinate grid. The average adult human body can be measured in heads. For example the average human is 7-8 heads tall. When doing this keep in mind that each person uses their own head to measure their own body. Other interesting measurements are in the picture below. What if you wanted to determine other measurements like the length from the wrist to the elbow or the length from the top of the neck to the hip? After completing this Concept you will know how to accurately measure using many different units of measurement. Guidance Distance is the length between two points. To measure is to determine how far apart two geometric objects are. Inch- rulers are usually divided up by 18 -in. (or 0.125 in) segments. Centimeter rulers are divided up by 10 -centimenter (or 0.1 cm) segments. The two rulers above are NOT DRAWN TO SCALE. Anytime you see this statement it means that the measured length is not actually the distance apart that it is labeled. You should never assume that objects are drawn to scale. Always rely on the measurements or markings given in diagram. The Ruler Postulate states that the distance between two points will be the absolute value of the difference between the numbers shown on the ruler. The ruler postulate implies that you do not need to start measuring at as long as you subtract the first number from the second. Absolute value is used because distance is always positive. Before we introduce the next postulate we need to address what the word between means in geometry. is between and in this picture. As long as is anywhere on the segment it can be considered to be between the endpoints. The Segment Addition Postulate states that if and are collinear and is between and then AB BC AC. The picture above illustrates the Segment Addition Postulate. If AB cm and BC 12 cm then AC must equal 12 or 17 cm. You may also think of this as the sum of the partial lengths will be equal to the whole length. In Algebra you worked with graphing lines and plotting points in the plane. At this point you can find the distances between points plotted in the plane if the lines are horizontal or vertical. If the line is vertical find the change in the ycoordinates. If the line is horizontal find the change in the xcoordinates. ,Here youll learn how to measure using ruler how to add Line segment and how to place Line (geometry) Line segment on Coordinate system grid.

The picture above illustrates the Line segment Addition Postulate. If AB cm and BC 12 cm then AC must Congruence (geometry) 12 or 17 cm. You may also think of this as the sum of the partial lengths will be Congruence (geometry) to the whole length.

4,4,1.4,Midpoints and Segment Bisectors,21,Here youll learn what midpoint segment bisector and perpendicular bisector are and how to use their properties to solve for unknown values. What if you were given the coordinates of two points and you wanted to find the point exactly in the middle of them? How would you find the coordinates of this third point? After completing this Concept youll be able to use the Midpoint Formula to find the location of such point in the coordinate plane and youll be able to give specific examples of lines that create midpoints. Because AB BC is the midpoint of AC. Any line segment will have exactly one midpoint. When points are plotted in the coordinate plane you can use slope to find the midpoint between then. We will generate formula here. Here are two points (-5 6) and (3 4). Draw line between the two points and determine the vertical distance and the horizontal distance. So it follows that the midpoint is down and over half of each distance. The midpoint would then be down (or -2) from (-5 6) and over positive 4. If we do that we find that the midpoint is (-1 4). Lets create formula from this. If the two endpoints are (-5 6) and (3 4) then the midpoint is (-1 4). -1 is halfway between -5 and and is halfway between and 2. Therefore the formula for the midpoint is the average of the xvalues and the average of the yvalues. +y Midpoint Formula: For two points (x and (x the midpoint is +x line segment or ray that passes through midpoint of another segment is called segment bisector. bisector cuts line segment into two congruent parts. specific type of segment bisector is called perpendicular bisector when the bisector intersects the segment at right angle. DE is the perpendicular bisector of AC so AB BC and AC DE. For every line segment there is one perpendicular bisector that passes through the midpoint. There are infinitely many bisectorsone perpendicular bisector for any segment. Investigation: Constructing Perpendicular Bisector 1. Draw line that is at least cm long about halfway down your page. 2. Place the pointer of the compass at an endpoint. Open the compass to be greater than half of the segment. Make arc marks above and below the segment. Repeat on the other endpoint. Make sure the arc marks intersect. 3. Use your straight edge to draw line connecting the arc intersections. ,Here youll learn what Midpoint Line segment bisector and Bisection are and how to use their properties to solve for unknown values. What if you were given the Coordinate system of two Point (geometry) and you wanted to find the Point (geometry) exactly in the middle of them? How would you find the Coordinate system of this third Point (geometry) After completing this Concept youll be able to use the Midpoint to find the location of such Point (geometry) in the Coordinate system Plane (geometry) and youll be able to give specific examples of Line (geometry) that create Midpoint Because AB BC is the Midpoint of AC.

Notice that there are two sets of measurements one opening clockwise and one opening counter-clockwise from to 180 When measuring angles always line up one side with and see where the other side hits the protractor. The vertex lines up in the middle of the bottom line where all the degree lines meet. For every angle there is number between and 180 that is the measure of the angle in degrees. The angles measure is then the absolute value of the difference of the numbers shown on the protractor where the sides of the angle intersect the protractor.

12,12,1.12,Polygon Classification,57,Here youll learn how to classify polygon based on its sides. Youll also learn how to decide whether polygon is convex or concave. What if you were told how many sides polygon has? How would you describe the polygon based on that information? After completing this Concept youll be able to classify polygon according to the number of sides it has. polygon is any closed planar figure that is made entirely of line segments that intersect at their endpoints. Polygons can have any number of sides and angles but the sides can never be curved. The segments are called the sides of the polygons and the points where the segments intersect are called vertices. The easiest way to identify polygon is to look for closed figure with no curved sides. Polygons can be either convex or concave. Think of the term concave as referring to cave or caving in. concave polygon has section that points inward toward the middle of the shape. All stars are concave polygons. convex polygon does not share this property. Diagonals are line segments that connect the vertices of convex polygon that are not sides. The red lines are all diagonals. This pentagon has diagonals. Whether polygon is convex or concave it can always be named by the number of sides. See the chart below. polygon is any closed planar figure that is made entirely of line segments that intersect at their endpoints.

15,15,2.2,If-Then Statements,74,Here youll learn how to rewrite statements in if-then form and determine the hypothesis and conclusion. Rube Goldman was cartoonist in the 1940s who drew crazy inventions to do very simple things. The invention below has series of smaller tasks that leads to the machine wiping the mans face with napkin. Write series of if-then statements to that would caption this cartoon from to M. After completing this Concept youll be able to rewrite statements into if-then form. Guidance conditional statement (also called an If-Then Statement) is statement with hypothesis followed by conclusion. Another way to define conditional statement is to say If this happens then that will happen. The hypothesis is the first or if part of conditional statement. The conclusion is the second or then part of conditional statement. The conclusion is the result of hypothesis. Keep in mind that conditional statements might not always be written in the if-then form. Here are few examples. Statement 1: If you work overtime then youll be paid time-and-a-half. Statement 2: Ill wash the car if the weather is nice. Statement 3: If divides evenly into then is an even number. Statement 4: Ill be millionaire when win monopoly. Statement 5: All equiangular triangles are equilateral. Statements and are written in the if-then form. The hypothesis of Statement is you work overtime. The conclusion is youll be paid time-and-a-half. So if Sarah works overtime then what will happen? From Statement we can conclude that she will be paid time-and-a-half. If goes evenly into 16 what can you conclude? From Statement we know that 16 must be an even number. Statement has the hypothesis after the conclusion. Even though the word then is not there the statement can be rewritten as: If the weather is nice then Ill wash the car. If the word if is in the middle of conditional statement the hypothesis is always after it. Statement uses the word when instead of if. It should be treated like Statement so it can be written as: If win monopoly then will be millionaire. In Statement if and then are not there but can be rewritten as: If triangle is equiangular then it is equilateral. Concept Problem Revisited The conditional statements are as follows: B: If the man raises his spoon then it pulls string. C: If the string is pulled then it tugs back spoon. D: If the spoon is tugged back then it throws cracker into the air. E: If the cracker is tossed into the air the bird will eat it. F: If the bird eats the cracker then it turns the pedestal. G: If the bird turns the pedestal then the water tips over. H: If the water tips over it goes into the bucket. I: If the water goes into the bucket then it pulls down the string. J: If the bucket pulls down the string then the string opens the box. K: If the box is opened then fire lights the rocket. L: If the rocket is lit then the hook pulls string. M: If the hook pulls the string then the mans faces is wiped with the napkin. This is very complicated contraption used to wipe mans face.

What if in fictitious far-away land poor peasant were awaiting his fate from the king? He is standing in stadium filled with spectators pointing and wondering what is going to happen. Finally the king directs everyones attention to two doors at the floor level with the peasant. Both doors have signs on them which are below: Logic is the study of reasoning. Deductive reasoning draws conclusions from facts. Typically conclusions are drawn from general statements about something more specific. Law of Detachment Here are two true statements: Every odd number is the sum of an even and an odd number. is an odd number. What can you conclude?

The converse of this theorem is also true. Angle Bisector Theorem Converse: If point is in the interior of an angle and equidistant from the sides then it lies on the bisector of the angle. Because the Angle Bisector Theorem and its converse are both true we have biconditional statement. We can put the two conditional statements together using if and only if. point is on the angle bisector of an angle if and only if it is equidistant from the sides of the triangle.

An altitude is line segment in triangle from vertex and perpendicular to the opposite side it is also known as the height of triangle. All of the red lines are examples of altitudes: As you can see an altitude can be side of triangle or outside of the triangle. When triangle is right triangle the altitude or height is the leg.

Specifically youll learn how to order the angles of triangle from largest to smallest based on the length of their opposite sides. What if two mountain bikers leave from the same parking lot and head in opposite directions on two different trails? The first rider goes miles due west then rides due south for 15 miles. The second rider goes miles due east then changes direction and rides 20 east of due north for 17 miles. Both riders have been traveling for 23 miles but which one is further from the parking lot? After completing this Concept you will be able to compare triangles in order to answer questions like this one. Look at the triangle below. The sides of the triangle are given. Can you determine which angle is the largest? As you might guess the largest angle will be opposite 18 because it is the longest side. Similarly the smallest angle will be opposite the shortest side 7. Therefore the angle measure in the middle will be opposite 13. Theorem: If one side of triangle is longer than another side then the angle opposite the longer side will be larger than the angle opposite the shorter side. Converse: If one angle in triangle is larger than another angle in triangle then the side opposite the larger angle will be longer than the side opposite the smaller angle. We have two congruent triangles 4ABC and 4DEF marked below: Therefore if AB DE and BC EF and then AC DF. Now lets adjust E. Would that make AC DF? Yes. See the picture below. The SAS Inequality Theorem (Hinge Theorem): If two sides of triangle are congruent to two sides of another triangle but the included angle of one triangle has greater measure than the included angle of the other triangle then the third side of the first triangle is longer than the third side of the second triangle. SSS Inequality Theorem (also called the Converse of the Hinge Theorem): If two sides of triangle are congruent to two sides of another triangle but the third side of the first triangle is longer than the third side of the second triangle then the included angle of the first triangle is greater in measure than the included angle of the second triangle Even though the two sets of lengths are not equal they both add up to 23. Therefore the second rider is further away from the parking lot because 110 90 Vocabulary The Triangle Sum Theorem states that the three angles in triangle always add up to 180 The median in triangle connects the midpoint of one side to the opposite vertex. An isosceles triangle is triangle with at least two congruent sides. ,Here youll learn how to compare sides and Angle in Triangle Specifically youll learn how to order the Angle of Triangle from largest to smallest based on the length of their opposite sides.

53,53,5.7,Triangle Inequality Theorem,274,Here youll learn the Triangle Inequality Theorem which will help you to determine whether three side lengths will create triangle or not. What if you had to determine whether the three lengths and 10 make triangle? After completing this Concept youll be able to use the Triangle Inequality Theorem to determine if any three side lengths make triangle. Can any three lengths make triangle? The answer is no. There are limits on what the lengths can be. For example the lengths cannot make triangle because so they would all lie on the same line. The lengths 10 also cannot make triangle because 9. The arc marks show that the two sides would never meet to form triangle. The Triangle Inequality Theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of triangle must be greater than the length of the third. The Triangle Inequality Theorem can also help you find the range of the third side. The two given sides are and 10 so the third side can either be the shortest side or the longest side.

What if you know something is true but cannot figure out how to prove it directly? After completing this Concept youll be able to indirectly prove statement by way of contradiction. Until now we have proved theorems true by direct reasoning where conclusions are drawn from series of facts and previously proven theorems. However we cannot always use direct reasoning to prove every theorem. Indirect Proof or Proof by Contradiction: When the conclusion from hypothesis is assumed false (or opposite of what it states) and then contradiction is reached from the given or deduced statements. In other words if you are trying to show that something is true show that if it was not true there would be contradiction (something else would not make sense). The steps to follow when proving indirectly are: Assume the opposite of the conclusion (second half) of the statement. Proceed as if this assumption is true to find the contradiction. Once there is contradiction the original statement is true. DO NOT use specific examples. Use variables so that the contradiction can be generalized.

59,59,6.4,Quadrilaterals that are Parallelograms,299,Here youll learn how to prove that quadrilateral is parallelogram. What if four friends Geo Trig Algie and Calc were marking out baseball diamond? Geo is standing at home plate. Trig is 90 feet away at rd base Algie is 127.3 feet away at nd base and Calc is 90 feet away at st base. The angle at home plate is 90 from st to rd is 90 Find the length of the other diagonal and determine if the baseball diamond is parallelogram. After completing this Concept youll be able to answer questions like this based on your knowledge of parallelograms. Recall that parallelogram is quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides. Even if quadrilateral is not marked with having two pairs of sides it still might be parallelogram. The following is list of theorems that will help you decide if quadrilateral is parallelogram or not. Opposite Sides Theorem Converse: If the opposite sides of quadrilateral are congruent then the figure is parallelogram Opposite Angles Theorem Converse: If the opposite angles of quadrilateral are congruent then the figure is parallelogram. Parallelogram Diagonals Theorem Converse: If the diagonals of quadrilateral bisect each other then the figure is parallelogram. Theorem: If quadrilateral has one set of parallel lines that are also congruent then it is parallelogram. Each of these theorems can be way to show that quadrilateral is parallelogram. To show that quadrilateral is parallelogram in the plane you will need to use combination of the slope formulas the distance formula and the midpoint formula. For example to use the Definition of Parallelogram you would need to find the slope of all four sides to see if the opposite sides are parallel. To use the Opposite Sides Converse you would have to find the length (using the distance formula) of each side to see if the opposite sides are congruent. To use the Parallelogram Diagonals Converse you would need to use the midpoint formula for each diagonal to see if the midpoint is the same for both. Finally you can use the last Theorem in this Concept (that if one pair of opposite sides is both congruent and parallel then the quadrilateral is parallelogram) in the coordinate plane. To use this theorem you would need to show that one pair of opposite sides has the same slope (slope formula) and the same length (distance formula). This means that the diagonals are equal. If the diagonals are equal the other two sides of the diamond are also 90 feet. Therefore the baseball diamond is parallelogram.

How could you determine if that quadrilateral qualifies as one of the special quadrilaterals: parallelograms squares rectangles rhombuses kites or trapezoids? After completing this Concept youll be able to make such determination. When working in the coordinate plane you will sometimes want to know what type of shape given shape is. You should easily be able to tell that it is quadrilateral if it has four sides. But how can you classify it beyond that? First you should graph the shape if it has not already been graphed. Look at it and see if it looks like any special quadrilateral. Do the sides appear to be congruent? Do they meet at right angles? This will give you place to start. Once you have guess for what type of quadrilateral it is your job is to prove your guess. To prove that quadrilateral is parallelogram rectangle rhombus square kite or trapezoid you must show that it meets the definition of that shape OR that it has properties that only that shape has. If it turns out that your guess was wrong because the shape does not fulfill the necessary properties you can guess again. If it appears to be no type of special quadrilateral then it is simply quadrilateral The examples below will help you to see what this process might look like. From this we see that the adjacent sides are congruent. Therefore RSTV is kite. Algebra Review: (1 16 25 out of the When asked to simplify the radical pull all square numbers radical. Above 50 25 2.

When working in the Coordinate system Plane (geometry) you will sometimes want to know what type of shape given shape is. You should easily be able to tell that it is quadrilateral if it has four sides. But how can you classify it beyond that? First you should graph the shape if it has not already been graphed. Look at it and see if it looks like any special quadrilateral. Do the sides appear to be congruent? Do they meet at right Angle This will give you place to start. Once you have guess for what type of quadrilateral it is your job is to prove your guess. To prove that quadrilateral is Parallelogram Rectangle Rhombus Square Kite (geometry) or Trapezoid you must show that it meets the definition of that shape OR that it has properties that only that shape has. If it turns out that your guess was wrong because the shape does not fulfill the necessary properties you can guess again.

In this lesson we will define three trigonometric (or trig) functions. Trigonometry: The study of the relationships between the sides and angles of right triangles. In trigonometry sides are named in reference to particular angle. The hypotenuse of triangle is always the same but the terms adjacent and opposite depend on which angle you are referencing. side adjacent to an angle is the leg of the triangle that helps form the angle. side opposite to an angle is the leg of the triangle that does not help form the angle. We never reference the right angle when referring to trig ratios. The three basic trig ratios are called sine cosine and tangent. At this point we will only take the sine cosine and tangent of acute angles. However you will learn that you can use these ratios with obtuse angles as well. Sine Ratio: For an acute angle in right triangle the sin is equal to the ratio of the side opposite the angle over the hypotenuse of the triangle. Using the triangle above sin ac and sin bc Cosine Ratio: For an acute angle in right triangle the cos is equal to the ratio of the side adjacent to the angle over the hypotenuse of the triangle.Using the triangle above cos bc and cos ac Tangent Ratio: For an acute angle in right triangle the tan is equal to the ratio of the side opposite to the angle over the side adjacent to x. Using the triangle above tan and tan ba There are few important things to note about the way we write these ratios. First keep in mind that the abbreviations sin cos and tan are all functions. Second be careful when using the abbreviations that you still pronounce the full name of each function. When we write sin it is still pronounced sine with long i. When we write cos we still say co-sine. And when we write tan we still say tangent. An easy way to remember ratios is to use the pneumonic SOH-CAH-TOA. few important points: Always reduce ratios when you can. Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the missing side (if there is one). The tangent ratio can be bigger than (the other two cannot). If two right triangles are similar then their sine cosine and tangent ratios will be the same (because they will reduce to the same ratio). If there is radical in the denominator rationalize the denominator. The sine cosine and tangent for an angle are fixed.

The closest you can get to the White House are the walking trails on the far right. You got as close as you could (on the trail) to the fence to take picture (you were not allowed to walk on the grass). Where else could you have taken your picture from to get the same frame of the White House? Where do you think the best place to stand would be? Your line of sight in the camera is marked in the picture as the grey lines. The white dotted arcs do not actually exist but were added to help with this problem. An inscribed angle is an angle with its vertex is the circle and its sides contain chords. The intercepted arc is the arc that is on the interior of the inscribed angle and whose endpoints are on the angle. The vertex of an inscribed angle can be anywhere on the circle as long as its sides intersect the circle to form an intercepted arc.

There are no gaps between the edges or vertices in polyhedron. Examples of polyhedrons include cube prism or pyramid. Non-polyhedrons are cones spheres and cylinders because they have sides that are not polygons. prism is polyhedron with two congruent bases in parallel planes and the lateral sides are rectangles. Prisms are explored in further detail in another Concept. pyramid is polyhedron with one base and all the lateral sides meet at common vertex. The lateral sides are triangles. Pyramids are explored in further detail in another Concept. All prisms and pyramids are named by their bases. So the first prism would be triangular prism and the second would be an octagonal prism. The first pyramid would be hexagonal pyramid and the second would be square pyramid. The lateral faces of pyramid are always triangles. Eulers Theorem states that the number of faces (F) vertices (V and edges (E) of polyhedron can be related such that +V 2. regular polyhedron is polyhedron where all the faces are congruent regular polygons. There are five regular polyhedra called the Platonic solids after the Greek philosopher Plato. These five solids are significant because they are the only five regular polyhedra.

Each of these polyhedra have name based on the number of sides except the cube. Regular Tetrahedron: 4-faced polyhedron where all the faces are equilateral triangles. Cube: 6-faced polyhedron where all the faces are squares. Regular Octahedron: An 8-faced polyhedron where all the faces are equilateral triangles.

What if your family were ready to fill the new pool with water and they didnt know how much water would be needed? The shallow end is ft. and the deep end is ft. The pool is 10 ft. wide by 25 ft. long. How many gallons of water will it take to fill the pool? There are approximately 7.48 gallons in cubic foot. After completing this Concept youll be able to answer this question. prism is 3-dimensional figure with congruent bases in parallel planes with rectangular lateral faces. The edges between the lateral faces are called lateral edges. All prisms are named by their bases so the prism below is pentagonal prism. This particular prism is called right prism because the lateral faces are perpendicular to the bases. Oblique prisms lean to one side or the other and the height is outside the prism. Surface Area Surface area is the sum of the areas of the faces of solid. Surface Area of Right Prism: The surface area of right prism is the sum of the area of the bases and the area of each rectangular lateral face. Volume Volume is the measure of how much space three-dimensional figure occupies. The basic unit of volume is the cubic unit: cubic centimeter (cm cubic inch (in cubic meter (m cubic foot etc. Each basic cubic unit has measure of one for each: length width and height. Volume of Rectangular Prism: If rectangular prism is units high units wide and units long then its volume is h. If we further analyze the formula for the volume of rectangular prism we would see that is equal to the area of the base of the prism rectangle. If the bases are not rectangles this would still be true however we would have to rewrite the equation little.

Determine your average footprint and write the rule for one stride. You may assume your stride starts at (0 0). After completing this Concept youll be able to answer this question. Transformations Summary Atransformation is an operation that moves flips or otherwise changes figure to create new figure. rigid transformation (also known as an isometry or congruence transformation) is transformation that does not change the size or shape of figure. The new figure created by transformation is called the image. The original figure is called the preimage. There are three rigid transformations: translations reflections and rotations. Atranslation is transformation that moves every point in figure the same distance in the same direction. rotation is transformation where figure is turned around fixed point to create an image. reflection is transformation that turns figure into its mirror image by flipping it over line. Composition of Transformations composition of transformations is to perform more than one rigid transformation on figure. One of the interesting things about compositions is that they can always be written as one rule. What this means is you dont necessarily have to perform one transformation followed by the next. You can write rule and perform them at the same time. You can compose any transformations but here are some of the most common compositions. 1. Glide Reflection: composition of reflection and translation. The translation is in direction parallel to the line of reflection. 2. Reflections over Parallel Lines Theorem: If you compose two reflections over parallel lines that are units apart it is the same as single translation of 2h units. Be careful with this theorem. Notice it does not say which direction the translation is in. So to apply this theorem you would still need to visualize or even do the reflections to see in which direction the translation would be. 3. Reflection over the Axes Theorem: If you compose two reflections over each axis then the final image is rotation of 180 of the original. With this particular composition order does not matter. Lets look at the angle of intersection for these lines. We know that the axes are perpendicular which means they intersect at 90 angle. The final answer was rotation of 180 which is double 90 Therefore we could say that the composition of the reflections over each axis is rotation of double their angle of intersection. 4. Reflection over Intersecting Lines Theorem: If you compose two reflections over lines that intersect at then the resulting image is rotation of 2x where the center of rotation is the point of intersection. transformation is an operation that moves flips or otherwise changes figure to create new figure. rigid transformation (also known as an isometry or congruence transformation) is transformation that does not change the size or shape of figure. The new figure created by transformation is called the image. The original figure is called the preimage. There are three rigid transformations: translations reflections and rotations. translation is transformation that moves every point in figure the same distance in the same direction. rotation is transformation where figure is turned around fixed point to create an image. reflection is transformation that turns figure into its mirror image by flipping it over line. composition (of transformations) is when more than one transformation is performed on figure. glide reflection is composition of reflection and translation. The translation is in direction parallel to the line of reflection. ,Here youll learn how to perform composition of transformations. Youll also learn some common composition of transformations.

Glide Reflection (mathematics) composition of Reflection (mathematics) and Translation (geometry) The Translation (geometry) is in direction Parallel (geometry) to the Line (geometry) of Reflection (mathematics) 2. Reflection (mathematics) over Parallel (geometry) Line (geometry) Theorem: If you compose two Reflection (mathematics) over Parallel (geometry) Line (geometry) that are units apart it is the same as single Translation (geometry) of 2h units. Be careful with this theorem. Notice it does not say which direction the Translation (geometry) is in. So to apply this theorem you would still need to visualize or even do the Reflection (mathematics) to see in which direction the Translation (geometry) would be. 3. Reflection (mathematics) over the Axes Theorem: If you compose two Reflection (mathematics) over each Cartesian coordinate system then the final image is Rotation (mathematics) of 180 of the original. With this particular composition order does not matter. Lets look at the Angle of intersection for these Line (geometry) We know that the axes are Perpendicular which means they intersect at 90 Angle The final answer was Rotation (mathematics) of 180 which is double 90 Therefore we could say that the composition of the Reflection (mathematics) over each Cartesian coordinate system is Rotation (mathematics) of double their Angle of intersection. 4. Reflection (mathematics) over Intersecting Line (geometry) Theorem: If you compose two Reflection (mathematics) over Line (geometry) that intersect at then the resulting image is Rotation (mathematics) of 2x where the center of Rotation (mathematics) is the Point (geometry) of intersection. transformation is an operation that moves Reflection (mathematics) or otherwise changes figure to create new figure. Rigid transformation (also known as an isometry or Congruence (geometry) transformation) is transformation that does not change the size or shape of figure. The new figure created by transformation is called the image. The original figure is called the preimage. There are three Rigid transformation Translation (geometry) Reflection (mathematics) and Rotation (mathematics) Translation (geometry) is transformation that moves every Point (geometry) in figure the same Distance in the same direction. Rotation (mathematics) is transformation where figure is turned around fixed Point (geometry) to create an image. Reflection (mathematics) is transformation that turns figure into its mirror image by Reflection (mathematics) it over Line (geometry) composition (of transformations) is when more than one transformation is performed on figure. glide Reflection (mathematics) is composition of Reflection (mathematics) and Translation (geometry) The Translation (geometry) is in direction Parallel (geometry) to the Line (geometry) of Reflection (mathematics) ,Here youll learn how to perform composition of transformations. Youll also learn some common composition of transformations. What if you were told that your own footprint is an example of glide <b>Reflection (mathematics)</b> The equations to find your average footprint are in the diagram below. Determine your average footprint and write the rule for one stride. You may assume your stride starts at (0 0). After completing this Concept youll be able to answer this question.
