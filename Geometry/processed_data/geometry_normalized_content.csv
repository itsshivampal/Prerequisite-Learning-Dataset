1,1,1.1,Basic Geometric Definitions,2,Here youll learn the basic geometric definitions and rules you will need to succeed in geometry. What if you were given picture of figure or an object like map with cities and roads marked on it? How could you explain that picture geometrically? After completing this Concept youll be able to describe such map using geometric terms. Guidance point is an exact location in space. point describes location but has no size. Dots are used to represent points in pictures and diagrams. These points are said Point Point and Point F. Points are labeled with CAPITAL letter. line is set of infinitely many points that extend forever in both directions. line like point does not take up space. It has direction location and is always straight. Lines are one-dimensional because they only have length (no width). line can by named or identified using any two points on that line or with lower-case italicized letter. This line can be labeled PQ QP or just g. You would say line PQ line QP or line respectively. Notice that the line over the PQ and QP has arrows over both the and Q. The order of and does not matter. plane is infinitely many intersecting lines that extend forever in all directions. Think of plane as huge sheet of paper that goes on forever. Planes are considered to be two-dimensional because they have length and width. plane can be classified by any three points in the plane. This plane would be labeled Plane ABC or Plane Again the order of the letters does not matter. We can use point line and plane to define new terms. Space is the set of all points extending in three dimensions. Think back to the plane. It extended along two different lines: up and down and side to side. If we add third direction we have something that looks like three-dimensional space or the real-world. Points that lie on the same line are collinear. and are collinear because they are all on line w. If point were located above or below line it would be non-collinear. Points andor lines within the same plane are coplanar. Lines and and points BC and are coplanar in Plane Line KF and point are non-coplanar with Plane An endpoint is point at the end of line segment. Line segments are labeled by their endpoints AB or BA. Notice that the bar over the endpoints has NO arrows. Order does not matter. ray is part of line with one endpoint that extends forever in the direction opposite that endpoint. ray is labeled by its endpoint and one other point on the line. Of lines line segments and rays rays are the only one where order matters. When labeling always write the endpoint under the side WITHOUT the arrow CD or DC. An intersection is point or set of points where lines planes segments or rays cross each other. Postulates With these new definitions we can make statements and generalizations about these geometric figures. This section introduces few basic postulates. Throughout this course we will be introducing Postulates and Theorems so it is important that you understand what they are and how they differ. Postulates are basic rules of geometry. We can assume that all postulates are true much like definition. Theorems are statements that can be proven true using postulates definitions and other theorems that have already been proven. The only difference between theorem and postulate is that postulate is proven true. We will prove theorems later in this course. Postulate 1: Given any two distinct points there is exactly one (straight) line containing those two points. Postulate 2: Given any three non-collinear points there is exactly one plane containing those three points. Postulate 3: If line and plane share two points then the entire line lies within the plane. Postulate 4: If two distinct lines intersect the intersection will be one point. Postulate 5: If two distinct planes intersect the intersection will be line. When making geometric drawings be sure to be clear and label all points and lines. Vocabulary point is an exact location in space. line is infinitely many points that extend forever in both directions. plane is infinitely many intersecting lines that extend forever in all directions. Space is the set of all points extending in three dimensions. Points that lie on the same line are collinear. Points andor lines within the same plane are coplanar. An endpoint is point at the end of part of line. line segment is part of line with two endpoints. ray is part of line with one endpoint that extends forever in the direction opposite that point. An intersection is point or set of points where lines planes segments or rays cross. postulate is basic rule of geometry is assumed to be true. theorem is statement that can be proven true using postulates definitions and other theorems that have already been proven. ,Space (mathematics)|Space (mathematics)|Space (mathematics)|Space (mathematics)|Space (mathematics)|Space (mathematics)|Collinearity|Collinearity|Collinearity|Geometry|Geometry|Geometry|Geometry|Geometry|Geometry|Geometry|Geometry|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment
2,2,1.2,Distance Between Two Points,10,Here youll learn how to measure using ruler how to add segments and how to place line segments on coordinate grid. The average adult human body can be measured in heads. For example the average human is 7-8 heads tall. When doing this keep in mind that each person uses their own head to measure their own body. Other interesting measurements are in the picture below. What if you wanted to determine other measurements like the length from the wrist to the elbow or the length from the top of the neck to the hip? After completing this Concept you will know how to accurately measure using many different units of measurement. Guidance Distance is the length between two points. To measure is to determine how far apart two geometric objects are. Inch- rulers are usually divided up by 18 -in. (or 0.125 in) segments. Centimeter rulers are divided up by 10 -centimenter (or 0.1 cm) segments. The two rulers above are NOT DRAWN TO SCALE. Anytime you see this statement it means that the measured length is not actually the distance apart that it is labeled. You should never assume that objects are drawn to scale. Always rely on the measurements or markings given in diagram. The Ruler Postulate states that the distance between two points will be the absolute value of the difference between the numbers shown on the ruler. The ruler postulate implies that you do not need to start measuring at as long as you subtract the first number from the second. Absolute value is used because distance is always positive. Before we introduce the next postulate we need to address what the word between means in geometry. is between and in this picture. As long as is anywhere on the segment it can be considered to be between the endpoints. The Segment Addition Postulate states that if and are collinear and is between and then AB BC AC. The picture above illustrates the Segment Addition Postulate. If AB cm and BC 12 cm then AC must equal 12 or 17 cm. You may also think of this as the sum of the partial lengths will be equal to the whole length. In Algebra you worked with graphing lines and plotting points in the plane. At this point you can find the distances between points plotted in the plane if the lines are horizontal or vertical. If the line is vertical find the change in the ycoordinates. If the line is horizontal find the change in the xcoordinates. ,Scaling (geometry)|Scaling (geometry)|Coordinate system|Collinearity|Angle|Angle|Congruence (geometry)|Congruence (geometry)|Distance|Distance|Distance|Distance|Distance|Geometry|Geometry|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment
3,3,1.3,Congruent Angles and Angle Bisectors,16,Here youll learn how to find unknown values using the definitions of angle congruency and angle bisector. Youll also learn how to construct an angle bisector. What if you knew that an angle was split exactly in half? How could you use this information to help you solve problems? After completing this Concept youll be able to bisect an angle and solve problems related to angle bisectors. Guidance When two rays have the same endpoint an angle is created. Here BA and BC meet to form an angle. An angle is labeled with an symbol in front of the three letters used to label it. This angle can be labeled ABC or CBA. Always put the vertex (the common endpoint of the two rays) in the middle of the three points. It doesnt matter which side point is written first. An angle bisector is ray that divides an angle into two congruent angles each having measure exactly half of the original angle. Every angle has exactly one angle bisector. BD is the angle bisector of ABC ABD DBC ABD ABC Label equal angles with angle markings as shown below. 1. Draw an angle on your paper. Make sure one side is horizontal. 2. Place the pointer on the vertex. Draw an arc that intersects both sides. 3. Move the pointer to the arc intersection with the horizontal side. Make second arc mark on the interior of the angle. Repeat on the other side. Make sure they intersect. 4. Connect the arc intersections from with the vertex of the angle. When two geometric figures have the same shape and size then they are congruent. An angle bisector is ray that divides an angle into two congruent angles each having measure exactly half of the original angle. ,Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Congruence (geometry)|Congruence (geometry)|Congruence (geometry)|Congruence (geometry)|Geometry|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Angle bisector theorem|Angle bisector theorem|Angle bisector theorem|Angle bisector theorem|Angle bisector theorem|Angle bisector theorem|Angle bisector theorem|Vertex (geometry)|Vertex (geometry)|Vertex (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection
4,4,1.4,Midpoints and Segment Bisectors,21,Here youll learn what midpoint segment bisector and perpendicular bisector are and how to use their properties to solve for unknown values. What if you were given the coordinates of two points and you wanted to find the point exactly in the middle of them? How would you find the coordinates of this third point? After completing this Concept youll be able to use the Midpoint Formula to find the location of such point in the coordinate plane and youll be able to give specific examples of lines that create midpoints. Because AB BC is the midpoint of AC. Any line segment will have exactly one midpoint. When points are plotted in the coordinate plane you can use slope to find the midpoint between then. We will generate formula here. Here are two points (-5 6) and (3 4). Draw line between the two points and determine the vertical distance and the horizontal distance. So it follows that the midpoint is down and over half of each distance. The midpoint would then be down (or -2) from (-5 6) and over positive 4. If we do that we find that the midpoint is (-1 4). Lets create formula from this. If the two endpoints are (-5 6) and (3 4) then the midpoint is (-1 4). -1 is halfway between -5 and and is halfway between and 2. Therefore the formula for the midpoint is the average of the xvalues and the average of the yvalues. +y Midpoint Formula: For two points (x and (x the midpoint is +x line segment or ray that passes through midpoint of another segment is called segment bisector. bisector cuts line segment into two congruent parts. specific type of segment bisector is called perpendicular bisector when the bisector intersects the segment at right angle. DE is the perpendicular bisector of AC so AB BC and AC DE. For every line segment there is one perpendicular bisector that passes through the midpoint. There are infinitely many bisectorsone perpendicular bisector for any segment. Investigation: Constructing Perpendicular Bisector 1. Draw line that is at least cm long about halfway down your page. 2. Place the pointer of the compass at an endpoint. Open the compass to be greater than half of the segment. Make arc marks above and below the segment. Repeat on the other endpoint. Make sure the arc marks intersect. 3. Use your straight edge to draw line connecting the arc intersections. ,Coordinate system|Coordinate system|Coordinate system|Coordinate system|Slope|Angle|Angle|Right angle|Distance|Distance|Distance|Edge (geometry)|Grade (slope)|Midpoint|Midpoint|Midpoint|Midpoint|Midpoint|Midpoint|Midpoint|Midpoint|Midpoint|Midpoint|Midpoint|Midpoint|Midpoint|Midpoint|Midpoint|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Two-dimensional space|Two-dimensional space|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinate system
5,5,1.5,Angle Measurement,26,Here youll learn how to measure an angle with protractor and how to apply the Angle Addition Postulate to find unknown values. What if you needed way to describe the size of an angle? After completing this Concept youll be able to use protractor to measure an angle in degrees. Guidance We measure line segments lengthprotractor. protractor is measuring device that measures how open an angle is. Angles are measured in degrees and labeled with symbol. Notice that there are two sets of measurements one opening clockwise and one opening counter-clockwise from to 180 When measuring angles always line up one side with and see where the other side hits the protractor. The vertex lines up in the middle of the bottom line where all the degree lines meet. For every angle there is number between and 180 that is the measure of the angle in degrees. The angles measure is then the absolute value of the difference of the numbers shown on the protractor where the sides of the angle intersect the protractor. In other words you do not have to start measuring an angle at as long as you subtract one measurement from the other. The Angle Addition Postulate states that if is on the interior of ADC then ADC ADB BDC. See the picture below. Drawing 1. Start by drawing horizontal line across the page about in long. 2. Place an endpoint at the left side of your line. 3. Place the protractor on this point. Make sure to put the center point on the bottom line of the protractor on the vertex. Mark 50 on the appropriate scale. 4. Remove the protractor and connect the vertex and the 50 mark. This process can be used to draw any angle between and 180 See http:www.mathsisfun.comgeometryprotr actor-using.html for an animation of this investigation. Copying an Angle with Compass and Straightedge 1. We are going to copy the angle created in the previous investigation 50 angle. First draw straight line about inches long and place an endpoint at one end. 2. With the point (non-pencil side) of the compass on the vertex draw an arc that passes through both sides of the angle. Repeat this arc with the line we drew in 1. 3. Move the point of the compass to the horizontal side of the angle we are copying. Place the point where the arc intersects this side. Open (or close) the mouth of the compass so you can draw an arc that intersects the other side of the arc drawn in 2. Repeat this on the line we drew in 1. 4. Draw line from the new vertex to the arc intersections. ,Scaling (geometry)|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Vertex (geometry)|Vertex (geometry)|Vertex (geometry)|Vertex (geometry)|Vertex (geometry)|Vertex (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Line segment
6,6,1.6,Angle Classification,33,Here youll learn how to classify angles based on their measure. What if you wanted to group different angles into different categories? After completing this Concept youll be able to classify angles geometrically. Guidance By looking at the protractor we measure angles from to 180 Angles can be classified or grouped into four different categories. Straight Angle: When an angle measures 180 The angle measure of straight line. The rays that form this angle are called opposite rays. Right Angle: When an angle measures 90 Notice the half-square marking the angle. This marking is always used to mark right or 90 angles. Acute Angles: Angles that measure between and 90 Obtuse Angles: Angles that measure between 90 and 180 It is important to note that 90 is NOT an acute angle and 180 is NOT an obtuse angle. Any two lines or line segments can intersect to form four angles. If the two lines intersect to form right angles we say the lines are perpendicular. The symbol for perpendicular is so these two lines would be labeled lm or AC DE. There are several other ways to label these two intersecting lines. This picture shows two perpendicular lines four right angles four 90 angles and even two straight angles ABC and DBE. Vocabulary straight angle is when an angle measures 180 right angle is when an angle measures 90 Acute angles are angles that measure between and 90 Obtuse angles are angles that measure between 90 and 180 If two lines intersect to form right angles the lines are perpendicular. ,Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Right angle|Right angle|Right angle|Right angle|Right angle|Geometry|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line segment|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular
7,7,1.7,Complementary Angles,37,Here youll learn what complementary angles are and how they can help you to solve problems. What if you knew that two angles together made right angle? After completing this Concept youll be able to use what you know about complementary angles to solve problems about these angles. Guidance Two angles are complementary when they add up to 90 Complementary angles do not have to be congruent to each other nor do they have to be next to each other. Two angles are complementary when they add up to 90 ,Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Right angle
8,8,1.8,Supplementary Angles,41,Here youll learn what supplementary angles are and how they can help you to solve problems. What if you were given two supplementary angles? How would you determine their angle measures? After completing this Concept youll be able to use the definition of supplementary angles to solve problems like this one. Two angles are supplementary when they add up to 180 Supplementary angles do not have to be congruent or touching. Two angles are supplementary when they add up to 180 ,Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle
9,9,1.9,Linear Pairs,44,Here youll learn what linear pairs are and how they can help you to solve problems. What if you notice two angles in picture that make straight line? What information does this give you about the angles? After completing this Concept youll be able to apply the properties of linear pairs to help you solve problems. Adjacent angles are two angles that have the same vertex share side and do not overlap. In the picture below PSQ and QSR are adjacent. linear pair is two angles that are adjacent and whose non-common sides form straight line. If two angles are linear pair then they are supplementary. PSQ and QSR are linear pair. Adjacent angles are two angles that have the same vertex share side and do not overlap. linear pair is two angles that are adjacent and whose non-common sides form straight line.

10,10,1.10,Vertical Angles,47,Here youll learn about vertical angles and how they can help you to solve problems in geometry. What if you want to know how opposite pairs of angles are related when two lines cross forming four angles? After completing this Concept youll be able to apply the properties of these special angles to help you solve problems in geometry. Vertical angles are two non-adjacent angles formed by intersecting lines. In the picture below and are vertical angles and and are vertical angles. Notice that these angles are labeled with numbers. You can tell that these are labels because they do not have degree symbol. Investigation: Vertical Angle Relationships 1. Draw two intersecting lines on your paper. Label the four angles created and 4. See the picture above. 2. Take your protractor and find 1. 3. What is the angle relationship between and 2? Find 2. 4. What is the angle relationship between and 4? Find 4. 5. What is the angle relationship between and 3? Find 3. 6. Are any angles congruent? If so write down the congruence statement. From this investigation hopefully you found out that and 4. This is our first theorem. That means it must be proven true in order to use it. Vertical Angles Theorem: If two angles are vertical angles then they are congruent. We can prove the Vertical Angles Theorem using the same process we used above. However lets not use any specific values for the angles. Recall that anytime the measures of two angles are equal the angles are also congruent. ,Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Congruence (geometry)|Congruence (geometry)|Geometry|Geometry|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)
11,11,1.11,Triangle Classification,51,Here youll learn how to classify triangle based on its angles and sides. What if you were given the angle measures or side lengths of several triangles and were asked to group them based on their properties? After completing this Concept youll be able to classify triangle as right obtuse acute equiangular scalene isosceles andor equilateral. Guidance triangle is any closed figure made by three line segments intersecting at their endpoints. Every triangle has three vertices (the points where the segments meet) three sides (the segments) and three interior angles (formed at each vertex). All of the following shapes are triangles. You might have also learned that the sum of the interior angles in triangle is 180 Later we will prove this but for now you can use this fact to find missing angles. Angles can be classified by their size: acute obtuse or right. In any triangle two of the angles will always be acute. The third angle can be acute obtuse or right. We classify each triangle by this angle. Right Triangle: When triangle has one right angle. Obtuse Triangle: When triangle has one obtuse angle. Acute Triangle: When all three angles in the triangle are acute. Equiangular Triangle: When all the angles in triangle are congruent. We can also classify triangles by its sides. Scalene Triangle: When all sides of triangle are all different lengths. Isosceles Triangle: When at least two sides of triangle are congruent. Equilateral Triangle: When all sides of triangle are congruent. Note that by the above definitions an equilateral triangle is also an isosceles triangle. triangle is any closed figure made by three line segments intersecting at their endpoints. Every triangle has three vertices (the points where the segments meet) three sides (the segments) and three interior angles (formed at each vertex). right triangle is triangle with one right angle. An obtuse triangle is triangle with one obtuse angle. An acute triangle is triangle where all three angles are acute. An equiangular triangle is triangle with all congruent angles. scalene triangle is triangle where all three sides are different lengths. An isosceles triangle is triangle with at least two congruent sides. An equilateral triangle is triangle with three congruent sides. ,Right triangle|Right triangle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Congruence (geometry)|Right angle|Right angle|Equilateral triangle|Equilateral triangle|Special right triangles|Special right triangles|Acute and obtuse triangles|Acute and obtuse triangles|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Vertex (geometry)|Vertex (geometry)|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle
12,12,1.12,Polygon Classification,57,Here youll learn how to classify polygon based on its sides. Youll also learn how to decide whether polygon is convex or concave. What if you were told how many sides polygon has? How would you describe the polygon based on that information? After completing this Concept youll be able to classify polygon according to the number of sides it has. polygon is any closed planar figure that is made entirely of line segments that intersect at their endpoints. Polygons can have any number of sides and angles but the sides can never be curved. The segments are called the sides of the polygons and the points where the segments intersect are called vertices. The easiest way to identify polygon is to look for closed figure with no curved sides. Polygons can be either convex or concave. Think of the term concave as referring to cave or caving in. concave polygon has section that points inward toward the middle of the shape. All stars are concave polygons. convex polygon does not share this property. Diagonals are line segments that connect the vertices of convex polygon that are not sides. The red lines are all diagonals. This pentagon has diagonals. Whether polygon is convex or concave it can always be named by the number of sides. See the chart below. polygon is any closed planar figure that is made entirely of line segments that intersect at their endpoints. The segments are called the sides of the polygons and the points where the segments intersect are called vertices. Polygons can be either convex or concave. concave polygon has section that points inward toward the middle of the shape. Diagonals are line segments that connect the vertices of convex polygon that are not sides.

13,13,2,Reasoning and Proof,64,This chapter explains how to reason and how to use reasoning to prove theorems about angle pairs and segments.

14,14,2.1,Conjectures and Counterexamples,81,Here youll learn how to make educated guesses or conjectures based on patterns. Youll also learn how to disprove conjectures with counterexamples. What if your older brother told you that all of his male friends at school play sports so all guys must play sports. How could you prove him wrong? After completing this Concept you will be able to make conjectures and disprove conjectures using counterexamples. conjecture is an educated guess that is based on examples in pattern. Numerous examples may make you believe conjecture. However no number of examples can actually prove conjecture. It is always possible that the next example would show that the conjecture is false. counterexample is an example that disproves conjecture. Concept Problem Revisited Your older brother made the conjecture that all guys must play sports. You could prove him wrong or disprove his conjecture by offering counterexample. Say your friend John is guy and does not play sports. Just one counterexample is enough to disprove your brothers conjecture. conjecture is an educated guess that is based on examples in pattern. counterexample is an example that disproves conjecture. ,
15,15,2.2,If-Then Statements,74,Here youll learn how to rewrite statements in if-then form and determine the hypothesis and conclusion. Rube Goldman was cartoonist in the 1940s who drew crazy inventions to do very simple things. The invention below has series of smaller tasks that leads to the machine wiping the mans face with napkin. Write series of if-then statements to that would caption this cartoon from to M. After completing this Concept youll be able to rewrite statements into if-then form. Guidance conditional statement (also called an If-Then Statement) is statement with hypothesis followed by conclusion. Another way to define conditional statement is to say If this happens then that will happen. The hypothesis is the first or if part of conditional statement. The conclusion is the second or then part of conditional statement. The conclusion is the result of hypothesis. Keep in mind that conditional statements might not always be written in the if-then form. Here are few examples. Statement 1: If you work overtime then youll be paid time-and-a-half. Statement 2: Ill wash the car if the weather is nice. Statement 3: If divides evenly into then is an even number. Statement 4: Ill be millionaire when win monopoly. Statement 5: All equiangular triangles are equilateral. Statements and are written in the if-then form. The hypothesis of Statement is you work overtime. The conclusion is youll be paid time-and-a-half. So if Sarah works overtime then what will happen? From Statement we can conclude that she will be paid time-and-a-half. If goes evenly into 16 what can you conclude? From Statement we know that 16 must be an even number. Statement has the hypothesis after the conclusion. Even though the word then is not there the statement can be rewritten as: If the weather is nice then Ill wash the car. If the word if is in the middle of conditional statement the hypothesis is always after it. Statement uses the word when instead of if. It should be treated like Statement so it can be written as: If win monopoly then will be millionaire. In Statement if and then are not there but can be rewritten as: If triangle is equiangular then it is equilateral. Concept Problem Revisited The conditional statements are as follows: B: If the man raises his spoon then it pulls string. C: If the string is pulled then it tugs back spoon. D: If the spoon is tugged back then it throws cracker into the air. E: If the cracker is tossed into the air the bird will eat it. F: If the bird eats the cracker then it turns the pedestal. G: If the bird turns the pedestal then the water tips over. H: If the water tips over it goes into the bucket. I: If the water goes into the bucket then it pulls down the string. J: If the bucket pulls down the string then the string opens the box. K: If the box is opened then fire lights the rocket. L: If the rocket is lit then the hook pulls string. M: If the hook pulls the string then the mans faces is wiped with the napkin. This is very complicated contraption used to wipe mans face. Purdue University liked these cartoons so much that they started the Rube Goldberg Contest in 1949. This past year the task was to pump hand sanitizer into someones hand in no less than 20 steps. conditional statement (also called an If-Then Statement) is statement with hypothesis followed by conclusion. The hypothesis is the first or if part of conditional statement.

16,16,2.3,"Converse, Inverse, and Contrapositive",77,"Here youll learn how to find the converse inverse and contrapositive of conditional statement. You will also learn how to determine whether or not statement is biconditional. What if your sister told you ""if you do the dishes then will help you with your homework Consider the statement: If the weather is nice then will wash the car. If then where the weather is nice and will wash the car. Or q. In addition to these positives we can also write the negations or nots of and q. The symbolic version of not is p. the weather is not nice will not wash the car Using these negations and switching the order of and we can create three more conditional statements. Converse www.ck12.org the weather is nice If {z wash {z the car then Inverse If wont {z wash the car the weather {z is not nice then Contrapositive If the weather dont wash {z the car then {z is not nice If we accept If the weather is nice then Ill wash the car as true then the converse and inverse are not necessarily true. However if we take the original statement to be true then the contrapositive is also true. We say that the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original if-then statement. It is sometimes the case that statement and its converse will both be true. These types of statements are called biconditional statements. So is true and is true. It is written with double arrow to indicate that it does not matter if or is first. It is said if and only if q. Replace the if-then with if and only if in the middle of the statement. If and only if can be abbreviated iff. conditional statement (also called an if-then statement) is statement with hypothesis followed by conclu- sion. The hypothesis is the first or if part of conditional statement. The conclusion is the second or then part of conditional statement. The conclusion is the result of hypothesis. The converse of conditional statement is when the hypothesis and conclusion are switched. The inverse of conditional statement is when both the hypothesis and conclusions are negated. The contrapositive of conditional statement is when the hypothesis and conclusions have been both switched and negated. When the original statement and converse are both true then the statement is biconditional statement. ",

The Locker Problemchange means closing lockers that are open and opening lockers that are closed). The fourth student will change the position of all locker doors numbered with multiples of four and so on. Imagine that this continues until the 1000 students have followed the pattern with the 1000 lockers. At the end which lockers will be open and which will be closed? After completing this Concept you will be able to use inductive reasoning solve this problem. Inductive reasoning is making conclusions based upon observations and patterns. Visual patterns and number patterns provide good examples of inductive reasoning. Lets look at some patterns to get feel for what inductive reasoning is. The Locker Problem Revisited Start by looking at the pattern. Red numbers are OPEN lockers. Student changes every locker: 8. 1000 Student changes every nd locker: 10 11 12. 1000 Student changes every rd locker: 10 11 12. 1000 Student changes every th locker: 10 11 12. 1000 If you continue on in this way the only lockers that will be left open are the numbers with an odd number of factors or the square numbers: 16 25 36 49 64 81 100 121 144 169 196 225 256 289 324 361 400 441 484 529 576 625 676 729 784 841 900 and 961.

18,18,2.5,Deductive Reasoning,70,Here youll learn how to deductively draw conclusions from facts using the Law of Detachment the Law of Contrapositive and the Law of Syllogism. What if in fictitious far-away land poor peasant were awaiting his fate from the king? He is standing in stadium filled with spectators pointing and wondering what is going to happen. Finally the king directs everyones attention to two doors at the floor level with the peasant. Both doors have signs on them which are below: Logic is the study of reasoning. Deductive reasoning draws conclusions from facts. Typically conclusions are drawn from general statements about something more specific. Law of Detachment Here are two true statements: Every odd number is the sum of an even and an odd number. is an odd number. What can you conclude? Based on only these two true statements there is one conclusion: is the sum of an even and an odd number.5 or 1). Lets change this example into symbolic form. number is odd It is the sum of an even and odd number So the first statement is q. The second statement is an odd number is specific example of p. number is 5. The conclusion is q. Again it is specific example such as or 3. The symbolic form is: symbol for therefore All deductive arguments that follow this pattern have special name the Law of Detachment. The Law of Detachment says that if is true statement and given then you can conclude q. Another way to say the Law of Detachment is: If is true and is true then is true. Law of Contrapositive The following two statements are true: If student is in Geometry then he or she has passed Algebra I. Daniel has not passed Algebra I. What can you conclude from these two statements? These statements are in the form: is the beginning of the contrapositive p) therefore the logical conclusion is p: Daniel is not in Geometry. This example is called the Law of Contrapositive. The Law of Contrapositive says that if is true statement and given then you can conclude p. Recall that the logical equivalent to conditional statement is its contrapositive. Therefore the Law of Contrapositive is logical argument. Law of Syllogism Determine the conclusion from the following true statements. If Pete is late Mark will be late. If Mark is late Karl will be late. So if Pete is late what will happen? If Pete is late this starts domino effect of lateness. Mark will be late and Karl will be late too. So if Pete is late then Karl will be lateLaw of Syllogism says that if and are true then is the logical conclusion. Typically when there are more than two linked statements we continue to use the next letter(s) in the alphabet to represent the next statement(s) and so on Concept Problem Revisited Analyze the two statements on the doors. Door A: IN THIS ROOM THERE IS LADY AND IN THE OTHER ROOM THERE IS TIGER. Door B: IN ONE OF THESE ROOMS THERE IS LADY AND IN ONE OF THE OTHER ROOMS THERE IS TIGER. We know that one door is true so the other one must be false. Lets assume that Door is true. That means the lady is behind Door and the tiger is behind Door B. However if we read Door carefully it says in one of these rooms which means the lady could be behind either door which is actually the true statement. So because Door is the true statement Door is false and the tiger is actually behind it. Therefore the peasant should pick Door B. Logic is the study of reasoning. Deductive reasoning draws conclusions from facts. ,Geometry|Geometry|Point (geometry)

What if you wanted to solve an equation and justify each step? What mathematical properties could you use in your justification? After completing this Concept you be able to see how the properties of equality from Algebra relate to geometric properties of congruence. The basic properties of equality were introduced to you in Algebra I. Here they are again: For all real numbers and c: Recall that AB CD if and only if AB CD. AB and CD represent segments while AB and CD are lengths of those segments which means that AB and CD are numbers. The properties of equality apply to AB and CD. This also holds true for angles and their measures. ABC DEF if and only if ABC DEF. Therefore the properties of equality apply to ABC and DEF. Just like the properties of equality there are properties of congruence. These properties hold for figures and shapes. When you solve equations in algebra you use properties of equality. You might not write out the logical justification for each step in your solution but you should know that there is an equality property that justifies that step. We will abbreviate Property of Equality PoE and Property of Congruence PoC. ,Angle|Congruence (geometry)|Congruence (geometry)|Congruence (geometry)|Congruence (geometry)|Congruence (geometry)|Congruence (geometry)|Congruence (geometry)|Congruence (geometry)|Congruence (geometry)|Congruence (geometry)|Congruence (geometry)|Congruence (geometry)|Congruence (geometry)|Geometry|Line segment|Line segment

Two-column proofs always have two columns- statements and reasons. The best way to understand two-column proofs is to read through examples. When writing your own two-column proof keep these things in mind: Number each step. Start with the given information. Statements with the same reason can be combined into one step. It is up to you. Draw picture and mark it with the given information. You must have reason for EVERY statement. The order of the statements in the proof is not always fixed but make sure the order makes logical sense. Reasons will be definitions postulates properties and previously proven theorems. Given is only used as reason if the information in the statement column was told in the problem. Use symbols and abbreviations for words within proofs. For example can be used in place of the word congruent. You could also use for the word angle. two-column proof is one common way to organize proof in geometry.

To mark lines parallel draw arrows () on each parallel line. If there are more than one pair of parallel lines use two arrows () for the second pair. The two lines below would be labeled AB || MN or || m. For line and point not on the line there is exactly one line parallel to this line through the point. There are infinitely many lines that pass through but only one is parallel to l. Skew lines are lines that are in different planes and never intersect. The difference between parallel lines and skew lines is parallel lines lie in the same plane while skew lines lie in different planes. transversal is line that intersects two distinct lines. These two lines may or may not be parallel. The area between and is the called the interior. The area outside and is called the exterior. The Parallel Lines Property is transitive property that can be applied to parallel lines. It states that if lines || and || then || n.

After proving two triangles are congruent we will use that information to prove other parts of the triangles are congruent as well as the properties of equilateral and isosceles triangles. ,Angle|Isosceles triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle
35,35,4.1,Triangle Sum Theorem,165,Here youll learn that the sum of the angles in any triangle is the same due to the Triangle Sum Theorem. What if you wanted to classify the Bermuda Triangle by its sides and angles? You are probably familiar with the myth of this triangle how several ships and planes passed through and mysteriously disappeared. The measurements of the sides of the triangle are in the image. What type of triangle is this? Using protractor find the measure of each angle in the Bermuda Triangle. What do they add up to? Do you think the three angles in this image are the same as the three angles in the actual In polygons interior angles are the angles inside of closed figure with straight sides. The vertex is the point where the sides of polygon meet. Triangles have three interior angles three vertices and three sides. triangle is labeled by its vertices with 4. This triangle can be labeled 4ABC 4ACB 4BCA 4BAC 4CBA or 4CAB. Order does not matter. The angles in any polygon are measured in degrees. Each polygon has different sum of degrees depending on the number of angles in the polygon. How many degrees are in triangle? Investigation: Triangle Tear-Up Tools Needed: paper ruler pencil colored pencils 1. Draw triangle on piece of paper. Try to make all three angles different sizes. Color the three interior angles three different colors and label each one and 3. 2. Tear off the three colored angles so you have three separate angles. 3. Attempt to line up the angles so their points all match up. What happens? What measure do the three angles add up to? This investigation shows us that the sum of the angles in triangle is 180 because the three angles fit together to form straight line. Recall that line is also straight angle and all straight angles are 180 The Triangle Sum Theorem states that the interior angles of triangle add up to 180 The above investigation is one way to show that the angles in triangle add up to 180 However it is not two-column proof. Here we will prove the Triangle Sum Theorem.

36,36,4.2,Exterior Angles Theorems,171,Here youll learn what an exterior angle is as well as two theorems involving exterior angles: that the sum of the exterior angles is always 360 and that in triangle an exterior angle is equal to the sum of its remote interior angles. What if you knew that two of the exterior angles of triangle measured 130 How could you find the measure of the third exterior angle? After completing this Concept youll be able to apply the Exterior Angle Sum Theorem to solve problems like this one. An exterior angle is the angle formed by one side of polygon and the extension of the adjacent side. In all polygons there are two sets of exterior angles one going around the polygon clockwise and the other goes around the polygon counterclockwise. By the definition the interior angle and its adjacent exterior angle form linear pair. The Exterior Angle Sum Theorem states that each set of exterior angles of polygon add up to 360 Remote interior angles are the two angles in triangle that are not adjacent to the indicated exterior angle. and are the remote interior angles for exterior angle ACD. The Exterior Angle Theorem states that the sum of the remote interior angles is equal to the non-adjacent exterior angle. From the picture above this means that ACD. Here is the proof of the Exterior Angle Theorem. From the proof you can see that this theorem is combination of the Triangle Sum Theorem and the Linear Pair Postulate. Given: 4ABC with exterior angle ACD Prove: ACD The third exterior angle of the triangle below is 1. By the Exterior Angle Sum Theorem: Interior angles are the angles on the inside of polygon while exterior angles are the angles on the outside of polygon. Remote interior angles are the two angles in triangle that are not adjacent to the indicated exterior angle. Two angles that make straight line form linear pair and thus add up to 180 The Triangle Sum Theorem states that the three interior angles of any triangle will always add up to 180 The Exterior Angle Sum Theorem states that each set of exterior angles of polygon add up to 360 ,Exterior angle theorem|Exterior angle theorem|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Congruence (geometry)|Congruence (geometry)|Polygon|Polygon|Polygon|Polygon|Polygon|Polygon|Polygon|Polygon|Polygon|Line (geometry)|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle
37,37,4.3,Congruent Triangles,178,Here youll learn what it means for two triangles to be congruent and how to find the corresponding parts of congruent triangles. What if you had quilt whose pattern was geometric and made up of several congruent figures? In order for these patterns to come together the quilter rotates and flips each block (in this case large triangle smaller triangle and smaller square) to get new patterns and arrangements. How many different sets of colored congruent triangles are there? How many triangles are in each set? How do you know these triangles are congruent? After completing this Concept youll be able to use your knowledge of congruent triangles in order to answer these questions. Recall that two figures are congruent if and only if they have exactly the same size and shape. If two triangles are congruent they will have exactly the same three sides and exactly the same three angles. In other words two triangles are congruent if you can turn flip andor slide one so it fits exactly on the other. 4ABC and 4DEF are congruent because AB DE BC EF AC DF and Notice that when two triangles are congruent their three pairs of corresponding angles and their three pairs of corresponding sides are congruent. When referring to corresponding congruent parts of congruent triangles you can use the phrase Corresponding Parts of Congruent Triangles are Congruent or its abbreviation CPCTC. Properties of Congruence Review Recall the Properties of Congruence: Reflexive Property of Congruence: Any shape is congruent to itself. AB AB or 4ABC 4ABC Symmetric Property of Congruence: If two shapes are congruent the statement can be written with either shape on either side of the sign. EFG XY and XY EFG or 4ABC 4DEF and 4DEF 4ABC Transitive Property of Congruence: If two shapes are congruent and one of those is congruent to third the first and third shapes are also congruent. 4ABC 4DEF and 4DEF 4GHI then 4ABC 4GHI These three properties will be very important when you begin to prove that two triangles are congruent. Concept Problem Revisited There are 16 triangles and they are all congruent. There are 16 triangles and they are all congruent.

38,38,4.4,Congruence Statements,183,Here youll learn how to write congruence statement and use congruence statements in order to identify corre- sponding parts. What if you were told that 4ABC 4XY How could you determine which side in 4XY is congruent to BA and which angle is congruent to C? After completing this Concept youll be able to use congruence statements to state which sides and angles are congruent in congruent triangles. When stating that two triangles are congruent use congruence statement. The order of the letters is very important as corresponding parts must be written in the same order. Notice that the congruent sides also line up within the congruence statement. AB LM BC MN AC LN We can also write this congruence statement several other ways as long as the congruent angles match up. For example we can also write 4ABC 4LMN as: One congruence statement can always be written six ways. Any of the six ways above would be correct. To be congruent means to be the same size and shape. Two triangles are congruent if their corresponding angles and sides are congruent.

39,39,4.5,Third Angle Theorem,187,Here youll learn the Third Angle Theorem and how to use it to determine information about two triangles with two pairs of angles that are congruent. What if you were given 4FGH and 4XY and you were told that and What conclusion could you draw about and Z? After completing this Concept youll be able to make such conclusion Find and J. The sum of the angles in each triangle is 180 by the Triangle Sum Theorem. So for 4ABC 35 +88 +m 180 and 57 For 4HIJ 35 88 180 and is also 57 Notice that we were given that and and we found out that J. This can be generalized into the Third Angle Theorem. Third Angle Theorem: If two angles in one triangle are congruent to two angles in another triangle then the third pair of angles must also congruent. In other words for triangles 4ABC and 4DEF if and then F. Notice that this theorem does not state that the triangles are congruent. That is because if two sets of angles are congruent the sides could be different lengths. See the picture below. Concept Problem Revisited For two given triangles 4FGH and 4XY you were told that and By the Third Angle Theorem Z. Vocabulary Two figures are congruent if they have exactly the same size and shape. Two triangles are congruent if the three corresponding angles and sides are congruent.

40,40,4.6,SSS Triangle Congruence,192,Here youll learn how to prove that two triangles are congruent given only information about the side lengths of the triangles. What if your parents were remodeling their kitchen so that measurements between the sink refrigerator and oven were as close to an equilateral triangle as possible? The measurements are in the picture at the left below. Your neighbors kitchen has the measurements on the right below. Are the two triangles congruent? After completing this Concept youll be able to determine whether or not two triangles are congruent given only their side lengths. Consider the question: If have three lengths in in and in can construct more than one triangle with these measurements? In other words can construct two different triangles with these same three lengths? Investigation: Constructing Triangle Given Three Sides Tools Needed: compass pencil ruler and paper 1. Draw the longest side (5 in) horizontally halfway down the page. The drawings in this investigation are to scale. 2. Take the compass and using the ruler widen the compass to measure in the next side. 3. Using the measurement from Step place the pointer of the compass on the left endpoint of the side drawn in Step 1. Draw an arc mark above the line segment. 4. Repeat Step with the last measurement in. Then place the pointer of the compass on the right endpoint of the side drawn in Step 1. Draw an arc mark above the line segment. Make sure it intersects the arc mark drawn in Step 3. 5. Draw lines from each endpoint to the arc intersections. These lines will be the other two sides of the triangle. Can you draw another triangle with these measurements that looks different? The answer is NO. Only one triangle can be created from any given three lengths. An animation of this investigation can be found at: http:www.mathsisfun.comgeometryconstruct-ruler-compass-1 .html Side-Side-Side (SSS) Triangle Congruence Postulate: If three sides in one triangle are congruent to three sides in another triangle then the triangles are congruent. Now we only need to show that all three sides in triangle are congruent to the three sides in another triangle. This is postulate so we accept it as true without proof. Think of the SSS Postulate as shortcut. You no longer have to show sets of angles are congruent and sets of sides are congruent in order to say that the two triangles are congruent. In the coordinate plane the easiest way to show two triangles are congruent is to find the lengths of the sides in each triangle. Finding the measure of an angle in the coordinate plane can be little tricky so we will avoid it in this text. Therefore you will only need to apply SSS in the coordinate plane. To find the lengths of the sides you will need to use the distance formula (x (y From what we have learned in this section the two triangles are not congruent because the distance from the fridge to the stove in your house is feet and in your neighbors it is 4.5 ft. The SSS Postulate tells us that all three sides have to be congruent. Vocabulary Two figures are congruent if they have exactly the same size and shape. By definition two triangles are congruent if the three corresponding angles and sides are congruent. The symbol means congruent. There are shortcuts for proving that triangles are congruent.

41,41,4.7,SAS Triangle Congruence,200,Here youll learn how to prove that two triangles are congruent given only information about two pairs of sides and included angles. What if you were given two triangles and provided with only two of their side lengths and the measure of the angle between those two sides? How could you determine if the two triangles were congruent? After completing this Concept youll be able to use the Side-Angle-Side (SAS) shortcut to prove triangles are congruent. An included angle is when an angle is between two given sides of triangle (or polygon). In the picture below the markings indicate that AB and BC are the given sides so would be the included angle. Consider the question: If have two sides of length in and in and the angle between them is 45 can construct only one triangle? Investigation: Constructing Triangle Given Two Sides and Included Angle Tools Needed: protractor pencil ruler and paper 1. Draw the longest side (5 in) horizontally halfway down the page. The drawings in this investigation are to scale. 2. At the left endpoint of your line segment use the protractor to measure 45 angle. Mark this measurement. 3. Connect your mark from Step with the left endpoint. Make your line in long the length of the second side. 4. Connect the two endpoints by drawing the third side. Can you draw another triangle with these measurements that looks different? The answer is NO. Only one triangle can be created from any given two lengths and the INCLUDED angle. Side-Angle-Side (SAS) Triangle Congruence Postulate: If two sides and the included angle in one triangle are congruent to two sides and the included angle in another triangle then the two triangles are congruent.

By definition two triangles are congruent if the three corresponding angles and sides are congruent. The symbol means congruent. There are shortcuts for proving that triangles are congruent. The SAS Triangle Postulate states that if two sides and the included angle in one triangle are congruent to two sides and the included angle in another triangle then the two triangles are congruent. ,Scaling (geometry)|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Congruence (geometry)|Polygon|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Transversal (geometry)|Line segment|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle
42,42,4.8,ASA and AAS Triangle Congruence,207,Here youll learn how to prove that two triangles are congruent given only information about two pairs of angles and pair of sides. What if your parents changed their minds at the last second about their kitchen layout? Now they have decided they to have the distance between the sink and the fridge be ft the angle at the sink 71 and the angle at the fridge is 50 You used your protractor to measure the angle at the stove and sink at your neighbors house. Are the kitchen triangles congruent now? After completing this Concept youll be able to use congruence shortcut to help you answer this question. Consider the question: If have two angles that are 45 and 60 and the side between them is in can construct only one triangle? We will investigate it here. Investigation: Constructing Triangle Given Two Angles and Included Side Tools Needed: protractor pencil ruler and paper 1. Draw the side (5 in) horizontally halfway down the page. The drawings in this investigation are to scale. 2. At the left endpoint of your line segment use the protractor to measure the 45 angle. Mark this measurement and draw ray from the left endpoint through the 45 mark. 3. At the right endpoint of your line segment use the protractor to measure the 60 angle. Mark this measurement and draw ray from the left endpoint through the 60 mark. Extend this ray so that it crosses through the ray from Step 2. 4. Erase the extra parts of the rays from Steps and to leave only the triangle. Can you draw another triangle with these measurements that looks different? The answer is NO. Only one triangle can be created from any given two angle measures and the INCLUDED side. Angle-Side-Angle (ASA) Triangle Congruence Postulate: If two angles and the included side in one triangle are congruent to two angles and the included side in another triangle then the two triangles are congruent. The markings in the picture are enough to say 4ABC 4XY Z. variation on ASA is AAS which is Angle-Angle-Side. Recall that for ASA you need two angles and the side between them. But if you know two pairs of angles are congruent then the third pair will also be congruent by the Third Angle Theorem. Therefore you can prove triangle is congruent whenever you have any two angles and side. Be careful to note the placement of the side for ASA and AAS. As shown in the pictures above the side is between the two angles for ASA and it is not for AAS. Angle-Angle-Side (AAS or SAA) Triangle Congruence Theorem: If two angles and non-included side in one triangle are congruent to two corresponding angles and non-included side in another triangle then the triangles are congruent. Concept Problem Revisited Even though we do not know all of the angle measures in the two triangles we can find the missing angles by using the Third Angle Theorem. In your parents kitchen the missing angle is 39 The missing angle in your neighbors kitchen is 50 From this we can conclude that the two kitchens are now congruent either by ASA or AAS. Vocabulary Two figures are congruent if they have exactly the same size and shape. By definition two triangles are congruent if the three corresponding angles and sides are congruent. The symbol means congruent. There are shortcuts for proving that triangles are congruent. The ASA Triangle Congruence Postulate states that if two angles and the included side in one triangle are congruent to two angles and the included side in another triangle then the two triangles are congruent. The AAS Triangle Congruence Theorem states that if two angles and non-included side in one triangle are congruent to two corresponding angles and non-included side in another triangle then the triangles are congruent. CPCTC refers to Corresponding Parts of Congruent Triangles are Congruent.

43,43,4.9,HL Triangle Congruence,214,Here youll learn how to prove that right triangles are congruent given the length of only their hypotenuses and one of their legs. What if you were given two right triangles and provided with only the measure of their hypotenuses and one of their legs? How could you determine if the two right triangles were congruent? After completing this Concept youll be able to use the Hypotenuse-Leg (HL) shortcut to prove right triangles are congruent. Recall that right triangle has exactly one right angle. The two sides adjacent to the right angle are called legs and the side opposite the right angle is called the hypotenuse. The Pythagorean Theorem says for any right triangle (leg) (leg) (hypotenuse) What this means is that if you are given two sides of right triangle you can always find the third. Therefore if you know that two sides of right triangle are congruent to two sides of another right triangle you can conclude that third sides are also congruent. HL Triangle Congruence Theorem: If the hypotenuse and leg in one right triangle are congruent to the hypotenuse and leg in another right triangle then the two triangles are congruent. The markings in the picture are enough to say 4ABC 4XY Z. Notice that this theorem is only used with hypotenuse and leg. If you know that the two legs of right triangle are congruent to two legs of another triangle the two triangles would be congruent by SAS because the right angle would be between them. Two figures are congruent if they have exactly the same size and shape. By definition two triangles are congruent if the three corresponding angles and sides are congruent. The symbol means congruent. There are shortcuts for proving that triangles are congruent. The HL Triangle Congruence Theorem states that if the hypotenuse and leg in one right triangle are congruent to the hypotenuse and leg in another right triangle then the two triangles are congruent. right triangle has exactly one right (90 angle. The two sides adjacent to the right angle are called legs and the side opposite the right angle is called the hypotenuse. HL can only be used with right triangles. ,Right triangle|Right triangle|Right triangle|Right triangle|Right triangle|Right triangle|Right triangle|Right triangle|Right triangle|Right triangle|Right triangle|Right triangle|Right triangle|Right triangle|Right triangle|Right triangle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Congruence (geometry)|Congruence (geometry)|Right angle|Right angle|Right angle|Right angle|Right angle|Right angle|Special right triangles|Special right triangles|Special right triangles|Special right triangles|Special right triangles|Special right triangles|Special right triangles|Special right triangles|Special right triangles|Special right triangles|Special right triangles|Special right triangles|Special right triangles|Special right triangles|Special right triangles|Special right triangles|Transversal (geometry)|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Pythagorean theorem
44,44,4.10,Isosceles Triangles,220,Here youll learn the definition of an isosceles triangle as well as two theorems about isosceles triangles. What if you were presented with an isoceles triangle and told that its base angles measure and What could you conclude about and y? After completing this Concept youll be able to apply important properties about isoceles triangles to help you solve problems like this one. An isosceles triangle is triangle that has at least two congruent sides. The congruent sides of the isosceles triangle are called the legs. The other side is called the base and the angles between the base and the congruent sides are called base angles. The angle made by the two legs of the isosceles triangle is called the vertex angle. Investigation: Isosceles Triangle Construction Tools Needed: pencil paper compass ruler protractor 1. Using your compass and ruler draw an isosceles triangle with sides of in in and in. Draw the in side (the base) horizontally inches from the top of the page. 2. Now that you have an isosceles triangle use your protractor to measure the base angles and the vertex angle. The base angles should each be We can generalize this investigation into the Base Angles Theorem. Base Angles Theorem: The base angles of an isosceles triangle are congruent. To prove the Base Angles Theorem we will construct the angle bisector through the vertex angle of an isosceles triangle. By constructing the angle bisector EG we designed two congruent triangles and then used CPCTC to show that the base angles are congruent. Now that we have proven the Base Angles Theorem you do not have to construct the angle bisector every time. It can now be assumed that base angles of any isosceles triangle are always equal. Lets further analyze the picture from step of our proof. Because 4DEG 4FEG we know that EGD EGF by CPCTC. Thes two angles are also linear pair so they are congruent supplements or 90 each. Therefore EGDF. Additionally DG GF by CPCTC so is the midpoint of DF. This means that EG is the perpendicular bisector of DF in addition to being the angle bisector of DEF. Isosceles Triangle Theorem: The angle bisector of the vertex angle in an isosceles triangle is also the perpendicular bisector to the base. The converses of the Base Angles Theorem and the Isosceles Triangle Theorem are both true. Base Angles Theorem Converse: If two angles in triangle are congruent then the opposite sides are also congruent. So for triangle 4ABC if then CB CA. would be the vertex angle. Isosceles Triangle Theorem Converse: The perpendicular bisector of the base of an isosceles triangle is also the angle bisector of the vertex angle. An isosceles triangle is triangle that has at least two congruent sides. The congruent sides of the isosceles triangle are called the legs. The other side is called the base. The angles between the base and the legs are called base angles. The angle made by the two legs is called the vertex angle. ,Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Congruence (geometry)|Congruence (geometry)|Midpoint|Angle bisector theorem|Angle bisector theorem|Angle bisector theorem|Angle bisector theorem|Angle bisector theorem|Angle bisector theorem|Vertex (geometry)|Vertex (geometry)|Vertex (geometry)|Vertex (geometry)|Vertex (geometry)|Vertex (geometry)|Vertex (geometry)|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle
45,45,4.11,Equilateral Triangles,227,Here youll learn the definition of an equilateral triangle as well as an important theorem about equilateral triangles. What if your parents want to redo the bathroom? Below is the tile they would like to place in the shower. The blue and green triangles are all equilateral. What type of polygon is dark blue outlined figure? Can you determine how many degrees are in each of these figures? Can you determine how many degrees are around point? After completing this Concept youll be able to apply important properties about equilateral triangles to help you solve problems like this one. By definition all sides in an equilateral triangle have exactly the same length. Investigation: Constructing an Equilateral Triangle Tools Needed: pencil paper compass ruler protractor 1. Because all the sides of an equilateral triangle are equal pick length to be all the sides of the triangle. Measure this length and draw it horizontally on your paper. 2. Put the pointer of your compass on the left endpoint of the line you drew in Step 1. Open the compass to be the same width as this line. Make an arc above the line. 3. Repeat Step on the right endpoint. 4. Connect each endpoint with the arc intersections to make the equilateral triangle. Use the protractor to measure each angle of your constructed equilateral triangle. What do you notice? From the Base Angles Theorem the angles opposite congruent sides in an isosceles triangle are congruent. So if all three sides of the triangle are congruent then all of the angles are congruent or 60 each. Equilateral Triangles Theorem: All equilateral triangles are also equiangular. Also all equiangular triangles are also equilateral. Concept Problem Revisited Lets focus on one tile. First these triangles are all equilateral so this is an equilateral hexagon (6 sided polygon). Second we now know that every equilateral triangle is also equiangular so every triangle within this tile has 360 angles. This makes our equilateral hexagon also equiangular with each angle measuring 120 Because there are angles the sum of the angles in hexagon are 6.120 or 720 Finally the point in the center of this tile has 660 angles around it. That means there are 360 around point. Vocabulary An isosceles triangle is triangle that has at least two congruent sides. The congruent sides of the isosceles triangle are called the legs. The other side is called the base. The angles between the base and the legs are called base angles and are always congruent by the Base Angles Theorem. The angle made by the two legs is called the vertex angle. An equilateral triangle is triangle with three congruent sides. Equiangular means all angles are congruent.

47,47,5.1,Midsegment Theorem,236,Here youll learn what midsegment is and how midsegments in triangles relate to the triangles. What if you created repeated design using the same shape (or shapes) of different sizes? This would be called fractal. Below is an example of the first few steps of one. What does the next figure look like? How many triangles are in each figure (green and white triangles)? Is there pattern? After completing this Concept youll be able to better understand how these fractals are created. midsegment is line segment that connects two midpoints of adjacent sides of triangle. For every triangle there are three midsegments. The Midsegment Theorem states that the midsegment of triangle is half the length of the side it is parallel to. Concept Problem Revisited To the left is picture of the th figure in the fractal pattern. The number of triangles in each figure is 13 and 40. The pattern is that each term increase by the next power of 3. line segment that connects two midpoints of the sides of triangle is called midsegment. midpoint is point that divides segment into two equal pieces. Two lines are parallel if they never intersect. Parallel lines have slopes that are equal. In triangle midsegments are always parallel to one side of the triangle. ,Slope|Congruence (geometry)|Congruence (geometry)|Polygon|Grade (slope)|Midpoint|Midpoint|Midpoint|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Parallel (geometry)|Parallel (geometry)|Parallel (geometry)|Parallel (geometry)
48,48,5.2,Perpendicular Bisectors,243,Here youll learn what perpendicular bisector is and the Perpendicular Bisector Theorem which states that if point is on the perpendicular bisector of segment then it is equidistant from the endpoints of the segment. What if an archeologist found three bones in Cairo Egypt buried meters meters and meters apart (to form triangle)? The likelihood that more bones are in this area is very high. The archeologist wants to dig in an appropriate circle around these bones. If these bones are on the edge of the digging circle where is the center of the circle? Can you determine how far apart each bone is from the center of the circle? What is this length? After completing this Concept youll be able to answer questions like these Recall that perpendicular bisector intersects line segment at its midpoint and is perpendicular. Lets analyze this figure. CD is the perpendicular bisector of AB. If we were to draw in AC and CB we would find that they are equal. Therefore any point on the perpendicular bisector of segment is the same distance from each endpoint. Perpendicular Bisector Theorem: If point is on the perpendicular bisector of segment then it is equidistant from the endpoints of the segment. In addition to the Perpendicular Bisector Theorem we also know that its converse is true. Perpendicular Bisector Theorem Converse: If point is equidistant from the endpoints of segment then the point is on the perpendicular bisector of the segment. Two lines intersect at point. If more than two lines intersect at the same point it is called point of concurrency. Investigation: Constructing the Perpendicular Bisectors of the Sides of Triangle Tools Needed: paper pencil compass ruler 1. Draw scalene triangle. 2. Construct the perpendicular bisector for all three sides. The three perpendicular bisectors all intersect at the same point called the circumcenter. Circumcenter: The point of concurrency for the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of triangle. 3. Erase the arc marks to leave only the perpendicular bisectors. Put the pointer of your compass on the circumcenter. Open the compass so that the pencil is on one of the vertices. Draw circle. What happens? The circumcenter is the center of circle that passes through all the vertices of the triangle. We say that this circle circumscribes the triangle. This means that the circumcenter is equidistant to the vertices. Concurrency of Perpendicular Bisectors Theorem: The perpendicular bisectors of the sides of triangle intersect in point that is equidistant from the vertices. If PC QC and RC are perpendicular bisectors then LC MC OC. Concept Problem Revisited The center of the circle will be the circumcenter of the triangle formed by the three bones. Construct the perpen- dicular bisector of at least two sides to find the circumcenter. After locating the circumcenter the archeologist can measure the distance from each bone to it which would be the radius of the circle. This length is approximately 4.7 meters. Vocabulary Perpendicular lines are lines that meet at right (90 angles. midpoint is the point on segment that divides the segment into two equal parts. perpendicular bisector is line that intersects line segment at its midpoint and is perpendicular to that line segment. When we construct perpendicular bisectors for the sides of triangle they meet in one point. This point is called the circumcenter of the triangle. ,Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Congruence (geometry)|Congruence (geometry)|Distance|Distance|Distance|Distance|Distance|Distance|Distance|Edge (geometry)|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Radius|Midpoint|Midpoint|Midpoint|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle
49,49,5.3,Angle Bisectors in Triangles,250,Here youll learn what an angle bisector is as well as the Angle Bisector Theorem which states that if point is on the bisector of an angle then the point is equidistant from the sides of the angle. What if the cities of Verticville Triopolis and Angletown were joining their city budgets together to build centrally located airport? There are freeways between the three cities and they want to have the freeway on the interior of these freeways. Where is the best location to put the airport so that they have to build the least amount of road? In the picture below the blue lines are the proposed roads. After completing this Concept youll be able to use angle bisectors to help answer this question. Recall that an angle bisector cuts an angle exactly in half. Lets analyze this figure. BD is the angle bisector of ABC. Looking at point if we were to draw ED and DF we would find that they are equal. Recall that the shortest distance from point to line is the perpendicular length between them. ED and DF are the shortest lengths between which is on the angle bisector and each side of the angle. Angle Bisector Theorem: If point is on the bisector of an angle then the point is equidistant from the sides of the angle. In other words if BD bisects ABC BEED and BFDF then ED DF. The converse of this theorem is also true. Angle Bisector Theorem Converse: If point is in the interior of an angle and equidistant from the sides then it lies on the bisector of the angle. Because the Angle Bisector Theorem and its converse are both true we have biconditional statement. We can put the two conditional statements together using if and only if. point is on the angle bisector of an angle if and only if it is equidistant from the sides of the triangle. Investigation: Constructing Angle Bisectors in Triangles Tools Needed: compass ruler pencil paper 1. Draw scalene triangle. Construct the angle bisector of each angle. Use Investigation 1-4 and from the Review Queue to help you. Incenter: The point of concurrency for the angle bisectors of triangle. 2. Erase the arc marks and the angle bisectors after the incenter. Draw or construct the perpendicular lines to each side through the incenter. 3. Erase the arc marks from and the perpendicular lines beyond the sides of the triangle. Place the pointer of the compass on the incenter. Open the compass to intersect one of the three perpendicular lines drawn in 2. Draw circle. Notice that the circle touches all three sides of the triangle. We say that this circle is inscribed in the triangle because it touches all three sides. The incenter is on all three angle bisectors so the incenter is equidistant from all three sides of the triangle. Concurrency of Angle Bisectors Theorem: The angle bisectors of triangle intersect in point that is equidistant from the three sides of the triangle. If AG BG and GC are the angle bisectors of the angles in the triangle then EG GF GD. In other words EG FG and DG are the radii of the inscribed circle. Concept Problem Revisited The airport needs to be equidistant to the three highways between the three cities. Therefore the roads are all perpendicular to each side and congruent. The airport should be located at the incenter of the triangle. Vocabulary An angle bisector cuts an angle exactly in half. Equidistant means the same distance from. point is equidistant from two lines if it is the same distance from both lines. When we construct angle bisectors for the angles of triangle they meet in one point. This point is called the incenter of the triangle. ,Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Congruence (geometry)|Distance|Distance|Distance|Distance|Distance|Distance|Distance|Distance|Distance|Distance|Distance|Distance|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Radius|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Angle bisector theorem|Angle bisector theorem|Angle bisector theorem|Angle bisector theorem|Angle bisector theorem|Angle bisector theorem|Angle bisector theorem|Angle bisector theorem|Angle bisector theorem|Angle bisector theorem|Angle bisector theorem|Angle bisector theorem|Angle bisector theorem|Angle bisector theorem|Angle bisector theorem|Angle bisector theorem|Angle bisector theorem|Angle bisector theorem|Angle bisector theorem|Angle bisector theorem|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle
50,50,5.4,Medians,256,Here youll learn the definitions of median and centroid and how to apply them. What if your art teacher assigned an art project involving triangles? You decide to make series of hanging triangles of all different sizes from one long piece of wire. Where should you hang the triangles from so that they balance horizontally? You decide to plot one triangle on the coordinate plane to find the location of this point. The coordinates of the vertices are (0 0) (6 12) and (18 0). What is the coordinate of this point? After completing this Concept youll be able to use medians to help you answer these questions. median is the line segment that joins vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side (of triangle). The three medians of triangle intersect at one point just like the perpendicular bisectors and angle bisectors. This point is called the centroid and is the point of concurrency for the medians of triangle. Unlike the circumcenter and incenter the centroid does not have anything to do with circles. It has different property. Investigation: Properties of the Centroid Tools Needed: pencil paper ruler compass 1. Construct scalene triangle with sides of length cm 10 cm and 12 cm (Investigation 4-2). Use the ruler to measure each side and mark the midpoint. 2. Draw in the medians and mark the centroid. Measure the length of each median. Then measure the length from each vertex to the centroid and from the centroid to the midpoint. Do you notice anything? 3. Cut out the triangle. Place the centroid on either the tip of the pencil or the pointer of the compass. What happens? From this investigation we have discovered the properties of the centroid. They are summarized below. Concurrency of Medians Theorem: The medians of triangle intersect in point that is two-thirds of the distance from the vertices to the midpoint of the opposite side. The centroid is also the balancing point of triangle. If is the centroid then we can conclude: In addition to these ratios is also the balance point of 4ACE. This means that the triangle will balance when placed on pencil at this point. Concept Problem Revisited The point that you should put the wire through is the centroid. That way each triangle will balance on the wire. The triangle that we wanted to plot on the plane is to the right. Drawing all the medians it looks like the centroid is (8 4). To verify this you could find the equation of two medians and set them equal to each other and solve for x. Two equations are and 4x 36. Setting them equal to each other we find that and then 4. Vocabulary median is the line segment that joins vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side in triangle. midpoint is point that divides segment into two equal pieces. centroid is the point of intersection for the medians of triangle. ,Coordinate system|Coordinate system|Coordinate system|Angle|Angle|Angle|Congruence (geometry)|Congruence (geometry)|Congruence (geometry)|Distance|Circle|Midpoint|Midpoint|Midpoint|Midpoint|Midpoint|Midpoint|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Angle bisector theorem|Vertex (geometry)|Vertex (geometry)|Vertex (geometry)|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment|Bisection|Bisection|Two-dimensional space|Perpendicular|Cartesian coordinate system|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle
51,51,5.5,Altitudes,262,Here youll learn the definition of altitude and how to determine where triangles altitude will be found. What if you were given one or more of triangles angle measures? How would you determine where the triangles altitude would be found? After completing this Concept youll be able to answer this type of question. An altitude is line segment in triangle from vertex and perpendicular to the opposite side it is also known as the height of triangle. All of the red lines are examples of altitudes: As you can see an altitude can be side of triangle or outside of the triangle. When triangle is right triangle the altitude or height is the leg. To construct an altitude construct perpendicular line through point not on the given line. Think of the vertex as the point and the given line as the opposite side. Investigation: Constructing an Altitude for an Obtuse Triangle Tools Needed: pencil paper compass ruler 1. Draw an obtuse triangle. Label it 4ABC like the picture to the right. Extend side AC beyond point A. 2. Construct perpendicular line to AC through B. The altitude does not have to extend past side AC as it does in the picture. Technically the height is only the vertical distance from the highest vertex to the opposite side. As was true with perpendicular bisectors angle bisectors and mediansthe altitudes of triangle are also concurrent. Unlike the other three the point does not have any special properties. Orthocenter: The point of concurrency for the altitudes of triangle. Here is what the orthocenter looks like for the three triangles. It has three different locations much like the perpendicular bisectors. The altitude of triangle also known as the height is line segment from vertex and perpendicular to the opposite side. Perpendicular lines are lines that meet at right (90 angles. The orthocenter of triangle is the point of concurrency for the altitudes of triangle (the point where all of the altitudes meet). ,Right triangle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Distance|Special right triangles|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Angle bisector theorem|Vertex (geometry)|Vertex (geometry)|Vertex (geometry)|Vertex (geometry)|Altitude (triangle)|Altitude (triangle)|Altitude (triangle)|Altitude (triangle)|Altitude (triangle)|Altitude (triangle)|Altitude (triangle)|Altitude (triangle)|Altitude (triangle)|Altitude (triangle)|Altitude (triangle)|Altitude (triangle)|Altitude (triangle)|Altitude (triangle)|Altitude (triangle)|Altitude (triangle)|Altitude (triangle)|Altitude (triangle)|Altitude (triangle)|Line segment|Line segment|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle
52,52,5.6,Comparing Angles and Sides in Triangles,268,Here youll learn how to compare sides and angles in triangles. Specifically youll learn how to order the angles of triangle from largest to smallest based on the length of their opposite sides. What if two mountain bikers leave from the same parking lot and head in opposite directions on two different trails? The first rider goes miles due west then rides due south for 15 miles. The second rider goes miles due east then changes direction and rides 20 east of due north for 17 miles. Both riders have been traveling for 23 miles but which one is further from the parking lot? After completing this Concept you will be able to compare triangles in order to answer questions like this one. Look at the triangle below. The sides of the triangle are given. Can you determine which angle is the largest? As you might guess the largest angle will be opposite 18 because it is the longest side. Similarly the smallest angle will be opposite the shortest side 7. Therefore the angle measure in the middle will be opposite 13. Theorem: If one side of triangle is longer than another side then the angle opposite the longer side will be larger than the angle opposite the shorter side. Converse: If one angle in triangle is larger than another angle in triangle then the side opposite the larger angle will be longer than the side opposite the smaller angle. We have two congruent triangles 4ABC and 4DEF marked below: Therefore if AB DE and BC EF and then AC DF. Now lets adjust E. Would that make AC DF? Yes. See the picture below. The SAS Inequality Theorem (Hinge Theorem): If two sides of triangle are congruent to two sides of another triangle but the included angle of one triangle has greater measure than the included angle of the other triangle then the third side of the first triangle is longer than the third side of the second triangle. SSS Inequality Theorem (also called the Converse of the Hinge Theorem): If two sides of triangle are congruent to two sides of another triangle but the third side of the first triangle is longer than the third side of the second triangle then the included angle of the first triangle is greater in measure than the included angle of the second triangle Even though the two sets of lengths are not equal they both add up to 23. Therefore the second rider is further away from the parking lot because 110 90 Vocabulary The Triangle Sum Theorem states that the three angles in triangle always add up to 180 The median in triangle connects the midpoint of one side to the opposite vertex. An isosceles triangle is triangle with at least two congruent sides. ,Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Congruence (geometry)|Congruence (geometry)|Midpoint|Vertex (geometry)|Isosceles triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle
53,53,5.7,Triangle Inequality Theorem,274,Here youll learn the Triangle Inequality Theorem which will help you to determine whether three side lengths will create triangle or not. What if you had to determine whether the three lengths and 10 make triangle? After completing this Concept youll be able to use the Triangle Inequality Theorem to determine if any three side lengths make triangle. Can any three lengths make triangle? The answer is no. There are limits on what the lengths can be. For example the lengths cannot make triangle because so they would all lie on the same line. The lengths 10 also cannot make triangle because 9. The arc marks show that the two sides would never meet to form triangle. The Triangle Inequality Theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of triangle must be greater than the length of the third. The Triangle Inequality Theorem can also help you find the range of the third side. The two given sides are and 10 so the third side can either be the shortest side or the longest side. For example could be because 10. It could also be 15 because 10 15. Therefore the range of values for is 16. Notice the range is no less than and not equal to 4. The third side could be 4.1 because 4.1 10. For the same reason cannot be greater than 16 but it could 15.9 10 15.9. The three lengths and 10 do make triangle. The sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third. Vocabulary An isosceles triangle is triangle with two congruent sides. The congruent sides are called the legs and the third side is called the base. The Triangle Inequality Theorem states that to make triangle two sides must add up to be greater than the third side. ,Triangle inequality|Triangle inequality|Triangle inequality|Triangle inequality|Triangle inequality|Congruence (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Isosceles triangle|Arc (geometry)|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle
54,54,5.8,Indirect Proof in Algebra and Geometry,277,Here youll learn how to write indirect proofs or proofs by contradiction by assuming hypothesis is false. What if you know something is true but cannot figure out how to prove it directly? After completing this Concept youll be able to indirectly prove statement by way of contradiction. Until now we have proved theorems true by direct reasoning where conclusions are drawn from series of facts and previously proven theorems. However we cannot always use direct reasoning to prove every theorem. Indirect Proof or Proof by Contradiction: When the conclusion from hypothesis is assumed false (or opposite of what it states) and then contradiction is reached from the given or deduced statements. In other words if you are trying to show that something is true show that if it was not true there would be contradiction (something else would not make sense). The steps to follow when proving indirectly are: Assume the opposite of the conclusion (second half) of the statement. Proceed as if this assumption is true to find the contradiction. Once there is contradiction the original statement is true. DO NOT use specific examples. Use variables so that the contradiction can be generalized. The easiest way to understand indirect proofs is by example. An Indirect Proof or Proof by Contradiction is method of proof where the conclusion from hypothesis is assumed to be false (or opposite of what it states) and then contradiction is reached from the given or deduced statements. ,
55,55,6,Polygons and Quadrilaterals,281,This chapter starts with the properties of polygons and narrows to focus on quadrilaterals.

56,56,6.1,Interior Angles in Convex Polygons,282,Here youll learn how to find the sum of the interior angles of polygon and the measure of one interior angle of regular polygon. Below is picture of Devils Post pile near Mammoth Lakes California. These posts are cooled lava (called columnar basalt) and as the lava pools and cools it ideally would form regular hexagonal columns. However variations in cooling caused some columns to either not be perfect or pentagonal. First define regular in your own words. Then what is the sum of the angles in regular hexagon? What would each angle be? After completing this Concept youll be able to answer questions like these. Recall that interior angles are the angles inside closed figure with straight sides. As you can see in the images below polygon has the same number of interior angles as it does sides. diagonal connects two non-adjacent vertices of convex polygon. Also recall that the sum of the angles in triangle is 180 What about other polygons? Investigation: Polygon Sum Formula Tools Needed: paper pencil ruler colored pencils (optional) 1. Draw quadrilateral pentagon and hexagon. 2. Cut each polygon into triangles by drawing all the diagonals from one vertex. Count the number of triangles. Make sure none of the triangles overlap. 3. Make table with the information below. 4. Do you see pattern? Notice that the total number of degrees goes up by 180 So if the number sides is then the number of triangles from one vertex is 2. Therefore the formula would be (n 2) 180 Polygon Sum Formula: For any ngon the sum of the interior angles is (n 2) 180 regular polygon is polygon where all sides are congruent and all interior angles are congruent. Regular Polygon Formula: For any equiangular ngon the measure of each angle is (n2)180 regular polygon has congruent sides and angles. regular hexagon has (6 2)180 180 720 total degrees.

57,57,6.2,Exterior Angles in Convex Polygons,288,Here youll learn the Exterior Angle Sum Theorem that states that the exterior angles of polygon always add up to 360 What if you were given twelve-sided regular polygon? How could you determine the measure of each of its exterior angles? After completing this Concept youll be able to use the Exterior Angle Sum Theorem to solve problems like this one. Recall that an exterior angle is an angle on the outside of polygon and is formed by extending side of the polygon. As you can see there are two sets of exterior angles for any vertex on polygon. It does not matter which set you use because one set is just the vertical angles of the other making the measurement equal. In the picture above the color-matched angles are vertical angles and congruent. The Exterior Angle Sum Theorem stated that the exterior angles of triangle add up to 360 Lets extend this theorem to all polygons. Investigation: Exterior Angle Tear-Up Tools Needed: pencil paper colored pencils scissors 1. Draw hexagon like the hexagons above. Color in the exterior angles as well. 2. Cut out each exterior angle and label them 1-6. 3. Fit the six angles together by putting their vertices together. What happens? The angles all fit around point meaning that the exterior angles of hexagon add up to 360 just like triangle. We can say this is true for all polygons. Exterior Angle Sum Theorem: The sum of the exterior angles of any polygon is 360 Concept Problem Revisited The exterior angles of regular polygon sum to 360 The measure of each exterior angle in dodecagon (twelve- sided regular polygon) is 360 12 30 Vocabulary An exterior angle is an angle that is formed by extending side of the polygon. regular polygon is polygon in which all of its sides and all of its angles are congruent. ,Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Congruence (geometry)|Polygon|Polygon|Polygon|Polygon|Polygon|Polygon|Polygon|Polygon|Polygon|Polygon|Polygon|Polygon|Polygon|Dodecagon|Hexagon|Hexagon|Hexagon|Point (geometry)|Vertex (geometry)|Triangle|Triangle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle|Internal and external angle
58,58,6.3,Parallelograms,291,Here youll learn what parallelogram is and how to apply theorems about its sides angles and diagonals. What if college wanted to build two walkways through parallelogram-shaped courtyard between two buildings? The walkways would be 50 feet and 68 feet long and would be built on the diagonals of the parallelogram with fountain where they intersect. Where would the fountain be? After completing this Concept youll be able to answer questions like this by applying your knowledge of parallelograms. Guidance parallelogram is quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides. Here are some examples: Notice that each pair of sides is marked parallel. As is the case with the rectangle and square recall that two lines are parallel when they are perpendicular to the same line. Once we know that quadrilateral is parallelogram we can discover some additional properties. Investigation: Properties of Parallelograms Tools Needed: Paper pencil ruler protractor 1. Draw set of parallel lines by placing your ruler on the paper and drawing line on either side of it. Make your lines inches long. 2. Rotate the ruler and repeat this so that you have parallelogram. Your second set of parallel lines can be any length. If you have colored pencils outline the parallelogram in another color. 3. Measure the four interior angles of the parallelogram as well as the length of each side. Can you conclude anything about parallelograms other than opposite sides are parallel? Draw the diagonals. Measure each and then measure the lengths from the point of intersection to each vertex. To continue to explore the properties of parallelogram see the website: http:www.mathwarehouse.comgeometryquadrilateralsparallelogramsinteractive-parallelogram.php In the above investigation we drew parallelogram. From this investigation we can conclude: Opposite Sides Theorem: If quadrilateral is parallelogram then the opposite sides are congruent. Opposite Angles Theorem: If quadrilateral is parallelogram then the opposite angles are congruent. Consecutive Angles Theorem: If quadrilateral is parallelogram then the consecutive angles are supplementary. Parallelogram Diagonals Theorem: If quadrilateral is parallelogram then the diagonals bisect each other. To prove the first three theorems one of the diagonals must be added to the figure and then the two triangles can be proved congruent. By the Parallelogram Diagonals Theorem the fountain is going to be 34 feet from either endpoint on the 68 foot diagonal and 25 feet from either endpoint on the 50 foot diagonal.

Geo is standing at home plate. Trig is 90 feet away at rd base Algie is 127.3 feet away at nd base and Calc is 90 feet away at st base. The angle at home plate is 90 from st to rd is 90 Find the length of the other diagonal and determine if the baseball diamond is parallelogram. After completing this Concept youll be able to answer questions like this based on your knowledge of parallelograms. Recall that parallelogram is quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides. Even if quadrilateral is not marked with having two pairs of sides it still might be parallelogram. The following is list of theorems that will help you decide if quadrilateral is parallelogram or not. Opposite Sides Theorem Converse: If the opposite sides of quadrilateral are congruent then the figure is parallelogram Opposite Angles Theorem Converse: If the opposite angles of quadrilateral are congruent then the figure is parallelogram. Parallelogram Diagonals Theorem Converse: If the diagonals of quadrilateral bisect each other then the figure is parallelogram. Theorem: If quadrilateral has one set of parallel lines that are also congruent then it is parallelogram. Each of these theorems can be way to show that quadrilateral is parallelogram. To show that quadrilateral is parallelogram in the plane you will need to use combination of the slope formulas the distance formula and the midpoint formula. For example to use the Definition of Parallelogram you would need to find the slope of all four sides to see if the opposite sides are parallel. To use the Opposite Sides Converse you would have to find the length (using the distance formula) of each side to see if the opposite sides are congruent. To use the Parallelogram Diagonals Converse you would need to use the midpoint formula for each diagonal to see if the midpoint is the same for both. Finally you can use the last Theorem in this Concept (that if one pair of opposite sides is both congruent and parallel then the quadrilateral is parallelogram) in the coordinate plane. To use this theorem you would need to show that one pair of opposite sides has the same slope (slope formula) and the same length (distance formula). This means that the diagonals are equal. If the diagonals are equal the other two sides of the diamond are also 90 feet. Therefore the baseball diamond is parallelogram.

60,60,6.5,Parallelogram Classification,308,Here youll learn what properties differentiate the three special parallelograms: rhombuses rectangles and squares. What if you were designing patio for you backyard? You decide to mark it off using your tape measure. Two sides are 21 feet long and two sides are 28 feet long. Explain how you would only use the tape measure to make your patio rectangle. After completing this Concept youll be able to answer this question using properties of special parallelograms. Rectangles rhombuses (the plural is also rhombi) and squares are all more specific versions of parallelograms. Rectangle Theorem: quadrilateral is rectangle if and only if it has four right (congruent) angles. Rhombus Theorem: quadrilateral is rhombus if and only if it has four congruent sides. Square Theorem: quadrilateral is square if and only if it has four right angles and four congruent sides. From the Square Theorem we can also conclude that square is rectangle and rhombus. Recall that diagonals in parallelogram bisect each other. Therefore the diagonals of rectangle square and rhombus also bisect each other. The diagonals of these parallelograms also have additional properties. Investigation: Drawing Rectangle Tools Needed: pencil paper protractor ruler 1. Draw two lines on either side of your ruler to ensure they are parallel. Make these lines inches long. 2. Remove the ruler and mark two 90 angles 2.5 inches apart on the bottom line drawn in Step 1. Then draw the angles to intersect the top line. This will ensure that all four angles are 90 Depending on your ruler the sides should be 2.5 inches and inch. 3. Draw in the diagonals and measure them. What do you discover? Theorem: parallelogram is rectangle if and only if the diagonals are congruent. Investigation: Drawing Rhombus Tools Needed: pencil paper protractor ruler 1. Draw two lines on either side of your ruler to ensure they are parallel. Make these lines inches long. 2. Remove the ruler and mark 50 angle at the left end of the bottom line drawn in Step 1. Draw the other side of the angle and make sure it intersects the top line. Measure the length of this side. 3. The measure of the diagonal (red) side should be about 1.3 inches (if your ruler is inch wide). Mark this length on the bottom line and the top line from the point of intersection with the 50 angle. Draw in the fourth side. It will connect the two endpoints of these lengths. 4. By the way we drew this parallelogram it is rhombus because all four sides are 1.3 inches long. Draw in the diagonals. Measure the angles created by the diagonals: the angles at their point of intersection and the angles created by the sides and each diagonal. You should find the measure of 12 angles total. What do you discover? parallelogram is quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides. quadrilateral is rectangle if and only if it has four right (congruent) angles: quadrilateral is rhombus if and only if it has four congruent sides: quadrilateral is square if and only if it has four right angles and four congruent sides. ,Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Congruence (geometry)|Congruence (geometry)|Rectangle|Rectangle|Rectangle|Rectangle|Rectangle|Rectangle|Rectangle|Rectangle|Rectangle|Rectangle|Parallelogram|Parallelogram|Parallelogram|Parallelogram|Parallelogram|Parallelogram|Parallelogram|Parallelogram|Right angle|Right angle|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Diagonal|Diagonal|Diagonal|Diagonal|Diagonal|Diagonal|Diagonal|Diagonal|Diagonal|Bisection|Bisection|Square|Square|Square|Square|Square|Square|Square|Square|Rhombus|Rhombus|Rhombus|Rhombus|Rhombus|Rhombus|Rhombus|Rhombus|Parallel (geometry)|Parallel (geometry)|Parallel (geometry)

What if you were told that the polygon ABCD is an isoceles trapezoid and that one of its base angles measures 38 What can you conclude about its other angles? After completing this Concept youll be able to find the value of trapezoids unknown angles and sides given your knowledge of the properties of trapezoids. trapezoid is quadrilateral with exactly one pair of parallel sides. Examples look like: An isosceles trapezoid is trapezoid where the non-parallel sides are congruent. The third trapezoid above is an example of an isosceles trapezoid. Think of it as an isosceles triangle with the top cut off. Isosceles trapezoids also have parts that are labeled much like an isosceles triangle. Both parallel sides are called bases. Recall that in an isosceles triangle the two base angles are congruent. This property holds true for isosceles trapezoids. Theorem: The base angles of an isosceles trapezoid are congruent. The converse is also true: If trapezoid has congruent base angles then it is an isosceles trapezoid. Next we will investigate the diagonals of an isosceles trapezoid. Recall that the diagonals of rectangle are congruent AND they bisect each other. The diagonals of an isosceles trapezoid are also congruent but they do NOT bisect each other. Isosceles Trapezoid Diagonals Theorem: The diagonals of an isosceles trapezoid are congruent. The midsegment (of trapezoid) is line segment that connects the midpoints of the non-parallel sides. There is only one midsegment in trapezoid. It will be parallel to the bases because it is located halfway between them. Similar to the midsegment in triangle where it is half the length of the side it is parallel to the midsegment of trapezoid also has link to the bases. Investigation: Midsegment Property Tools Needed: graph paper pencil ruler 1. Draw trapezoid on your graph paper with vertices A(1 5) B(2 5) C(6 1) and D(3 1). Notice this is NOT an isosceles trapezoid. 2. Find the midpoint of the non-parallel sides either by using slopes or the midpoint formula. Label them and F. Connect the midpoints to create the midsegment. 3. Find the lengths of AB EF and CD. Can you write formula to find the midsegment? Midsegment Theorem: The length of the midsegment of trapezoid is the average of the lengths of the bases or EF AB+CD trapezoid is quadrilateral with exactly one pair of parallel sides. An isosceles trapezoid is trapezoid where the non-parallel sides and base angles are congruent. The midsegment (of trapezoid) is line segment that connects the midpoints of the non-parallel sides. ,Slope|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Polygon|Rectangle|Trapezoid|Trapezoid|Trapezoid|Trapezoid|Trapezoid|Trapezoid|Trapezoid|Trapezoid|Trapezoid|Trapezoid|Trapezoid|Trapezoid|Trapezoid|Trapezoid|Trapezoid|Trapezoid|Trapezoid|Trapezoid|Trapezoid|Trapezoid|Trapezoid|Trapezoid|Trapezoid|Trapezoid|Trapezoid|Trapezoid|Trapezoid|Trapezoid|Similarity (geometry)|Grade (slope)|Midpoint|Midpoint|Midpoint|Midpoint|Midpoint|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Diagonal|Diagonal|Diagonal|Diagonal|Diagonal|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Line segment|Line segment|Bisection|Bisection|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Parallel (geometry)|Parallel (geometry)|Parallel (geometry)|Parallel (geometry)|Parallel (geometry)|Parallel (geometry)|Parallel (geometry)|Parallel (geometry)|Parallel (geometry)|Parallel (geometry)

What if you made traditional kite seen below by placing two pieces of wood perpendicular to each other (one bisected by the other)? The typical dimensions are included in the picture. If you have two pieces of wood 36 inches and 54 inches determine the values of and 2x. Then determine how large piece of canvas you would need to make the kite (find the perimeter of the kite). After completing this Concept youll be able to answer these questions using your knowledge of kites. kite is quadrilateral with two sets of distinct adjacent congruent sides. few examples: From the definition kite is the only quadrilateral that we have discussed that could be concave as with the case of the last kite. If kite is concave it is called dart. The angles between the congruent sides are called vertex angles. The other angles are called non-vertex angles. If we draw the diagonal through the vertex angles we would have two congruent triangles. Theorem: The diagonal through the vertex angles is the angle bisector for both angles. The proof of this theorem is very similar to the proof above for the first theorem. If we draw in the other diagonal in KIT we find that the two diagonals are perpendicular. Kite Diagonals Theorem: The diagonals of kite are perpendicular. To prove that the diagonals are perpendicular look at 4KET and 4KIT Both of these triangles are isosceles triangles which means EI is the perpendicular bisector of KT (the Isosceles Triangle Theorem). Use this information to help you prove the diagonals are perpendicular in the practice questions. If the diagonals (pieces of wood) are 36 inches and 54 inches is half of 36 or 18 inches. Then 2x is 36.

63,63,6.8,Quadrilateral Classification,328,Here youll learn how to classify quadrilaterals in the coordinate plane. What if you were given quadrilateral in the coordinate plane? How could you determine if that quadrilateral qualifies as one of the special quadrilaterals: parallelograms squares rectangles rhombuses kites or trapezoids? After completing this Concept youll be able to make such determination. When working in the coordinate plane you will sometimes want to know what type of shape given shape is. You should easily be able to tell that it is quadrilateral if it has four sides. But how can you classify it beyond that? First you should graph the shape if it has not already been graphed. Look at it and see if it looks like any special quadrilateral. Do the sides appear to be congruent? Do they meet at right angles? This will give you place to start. Once you have guess for what type of quadrilateral it is your job is to prove your guess. To prove that quadrilateral is parallelogram rectangle rhombus square kite or trapezoid you must show that it meets the definition of that shape OR that it has properties that only that shape has. If it turns out that your guess was wrong because the shape does not fulfill the necessary properties you can guess again. If it appears to be no type of special quadrilateral then it is simply quadrilateral The examples below will help you to see what this process might look like. From this we see that the adjacent sides are congruent. Therefore RSTV is kite. Algebra Review: (1 16 25 out of the When asked to simplify the radical pull all square numbers radical. Above 50 25 2.

If the model measures 0.75 feet long how long is the real python? After completing this Concept youll be able to solve problems like this one by using proportion. proportion is when two ratios are set equal to each other. Cross-Multiplication Theorem: Let and be real numbers with and 0. If then ad bc. The proof of the Cross-Multiplication Theorem is an algebraic proof. Recall that multiplying by 22 bb or because it is the same number divided by itself (b 1). Proof of the Cross-Multiplication Theorem: Think of the Cross-Multiplication Theorem as shortcut. Without this theorem you would have to go through all of these steps every time to solve proportion. The Cross-Multiplication Theorem has several sub-theorems that follow from its proof. The formal term is corollary. Corollary 1: If and are nonzero and then Corollary 2: If and are nonzero and then Corollary 3: If and are nonzero and then dc Corollary 4: If and are nonzero and then a+b c+d Corollary 5: If and are nonzero and then ab cd ratio is way to compare two numbers. Ratios can be written in three ways: ab and to b. proportion is two ratios that are set equal to each other. To solve proportion you should cross-multiply which means to set the product of the numerator of the first fraction and the denominator of the second fraction equal to the product of the denominator of the first fraction and the numerator of the second fraction. corollary is theorem that follows directly from another theorem. ,Scaling (geometry)|Congruence (geometry)|Congruence (geometry)|Congruence (geometry)

What if you were comparing baseball diamond and softball diamond? baseball diamond is square with 90 foot sides. softball diamond is square with 60 foot sides. Are the two diamonds similar? If so what is the scale factor? After completing this Concept youll be able to use your knowledge of similar polygons to answer these questions. Similar polygons are two polygons with the same shape but not necessarily the same size. Similar polygons have corresponding angles that are congruent and corresponding sides that are proportional. These polygons are not similar: Think about similar polygons as enlarging or shrinking the same shape. The symbol is used to represent similarity. Specific types of triangles quadrilaterals and polygons will always be similar. For example all equilateral triangles are similar and all squares are similar. If two polygons are similar we know the lengths of corresponding sides are proportional. In similar polygons the ratio of one side of polygon to the corresponding side of the other is called the scale factor. The ratio of all parts of polygon (including the perimeters diagonals medians midsegments altitudes) is the same as the ratio of the sides. Similar polygons are two polygons with the same shape but not necessarily the same size. The corresponding angles of similar polygons are congruent (exactly the same) and the corresponding sides are proportional (in the same ratio).

Repeat Step and make the horizontal side between the 45 and 60 angle at least inch longer than in Step 1. This will make the entire triangle larger. Find the measure of the third angle and measure the length of each side. 3. Find the ratio of the sides. Put the sides opposite the 45 angles over each other the sides opposite the 60 angles over each other and the sides opposite the third angles over each other. What happens? AA Similarity Postulate: If two angles in one triangle are congruent to two angles in another triangle the two triangles are similar.

Youll also learn how to use dilated figures in the coordinate plane to find scale factors. What if you were given the coordinates of figure and were asked to dilate that figure by scale factor of 2? How could you find the coordinates of the dilated figure? After completing this Concept youll be able to solve problems dilation makes figure larger or smaller but has the same shape as the original. In other words the dilation is similar to the original. All dilations have center and scale factor. The center is the point of reference for the dilation (like the vanishing point in perspective drawing) and scale factor tells us how much the figure stretches or shrinks. scale factor is typically labeled and is always greater than zero. Also if the original figure is labeled 4ABC for example the dilation would be 4A The indicates that it is copy. This tic mark is said prime so is read prime. second dilation would be 00 read double-prime. If the dilated image is smaller than the original then the scale factor is If the dilated image is larger than the original then the scale factor is To dilate something in the coordinate plane multiply each coordinate by the scale factor. This is called mapping. For any dilation the mapping will be (x y) (kx ky). In this Concept the center of dilation will always be the origin unless otherwise stated. In the graph above the blue quadrilateral is the original and the red image is the dilation. dilation an enlargement or reduction of figure that preserves shape but not size.

79,79,8.1,Expressions with Radicals,409,Here youll learn the Pythagorean Theorem and how to apply it in order to find missing sides of right triangles and determine whether or not triangles are right triangles. What if friend of yours wanted to design rectangular building with one wall 65 ft long and the other wall 72 ft long? How can he ensure the walls are going to be perpendicular? After completing this Concept youll be able to apply the Pythagorean Theorem in order to solve problems like these. The sides of right triangle are called legs (the sides of the right angle) and the side opposite the right angle is the hypotenuse. For the Pythagorean Theorem the legs are and and the hypotenuse is c. Pythagorean Theorem: Given right triangle with legs of lengths and and hypotenuse of length then Pythagorean Theorem Converse: If the square of the longest side of triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides then the triangle is right triangle. There are several proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem shown below. Investigation: Proof of the Pythagorean Theorem Tools Needed: pencil pieces of graph paper ruler scissors colored pencils (optional) 1. On the graph paper draw in. square in. square in square and right triangle with legs of and inches. 2. Cut out the triangle and square and arrange them like the picture on the right. 3. This theorem relies on area. Recall from previous math class that the area of square is length times width. But because the sides are the same you can rewrite this formula as square length width side side side So the Pythagorean Theorem can be interpreted as (square with side a) (square with side b) (square with side c) In this Investigation the sides are and inches. What is the area of each square? 4. Now we know that 16 25 or Cut the smaller squares to fit into the larger square thus proving the areas are equal. Another Proof of the Pythagorean Theorem This proof is more formal meaning that we will use letters and to represent the sides of the right triangle. In this particular proof we will take four right triangles with legs and and hypotenuse and make the areas equal. For two animated proofs go to http:www.mathsisfun.compythagoras.html and scroll down to And You Can Prove the Theorem Yourself. Pythagorean Triples Pythagorean Triple is set of three whole numbers that makes the Pythagorean Theorem true. The most frequently used Pythagorean triple is as in Investigation 8-1. Any multiple of Pythagorean triple is also considered triple because it would still be three whole numbers. Therefore 10 and 12 15 are also sides of right triangle. Other Pythagorean triples are: 12 13 24 25 15 17 There are infinitely many Pythagorean triples. To see if set of numbers makes triple plug them into the Pythagorean Theorem The two shorter sides of right triangle (the sides that form the right angle) are the legs and the longer side (the side opposite the right angle) is the hypotenuse.

What if you had 52"" High Definition Television (52"" being the length of the diagonal of the rectangular viewing area)? High Definition Televisions (HDTVs) have sides in the ratio of 16:9. What is the length and width of 52 HDTV? What is the length and width of an HDTV with long diagonal? There are many different applications of the Pythagorean Theorem. Three applications are explored below. Find the Height of an Isosceles Triangle One way to use The Pythagorean Theorem is to identify the heights in isosceles triangles so you can calculate the area. The area of triangle is 12 bh where is the base and is the height (or altitude). If you are given the base and the sides of an isosceles triangle you can use the Pythagorean Theorem to calculate the height. Prove the Distance Formula Another application of the Pythagorean Theorem is the Distance Formula. First draw the vertical and horizontal lengths to make right triangle. Then use the differences to find these distances. Now that we have right triangle we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find d. Distance Formula: The distance A(x and B(x is (x (y Determine if Triangle is Acute Obtuse or Right We can extend the converse of the Pythagorean Theorem to determine if triangle has an obtuse angle or is acute. We know that if the sum of the squares of the two smaller sides equals the square of the larger side then the triangle is right. We can also interpret the outcome if the sum of the squares of the smaller sides does not equal the square of the third. Theorem: (1) If the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides in right triangle is greater than the square of the longest side then the triangle is acute. (2) If the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides in right triangle is less than the square of the longest side then the triangle is obtuse. In other words: The sides of triangle are and and and a. If then the triangle is acute. If then the triangle is right. If then the triangle is obtuse. The two shorter sides of right triangle (the sides that form the right angle) are the legs and the longer side (the side opposite the right angle) is the hypotenuse. The Pythagorean Theorem states that where the legs are and and the hypotenuse is c. Acute triangles are triangles where all angles are less than 90 Right triangles are triangles with one 90 angle.

What if you were told that in California the average home price increased 21.3 in 2004 and another 16.0 in 2005? What is the average rate of increase for these two years? After completing this Concept you will be able to use the geometric mean to help solve this problem. If two objects are similar corresponding angles are congruent and their sides are proportional in length. Lets look at right triangle with an altitude drawn from the right angle. There are three right triangles in this picture 4ADB 4CDA and 4CAB. Both of the two smaller triangles are similar to the larger triangle because they each share an angle with 4ADB. That means all three triangles are similar to each other. Inscribed Triangle Theorem: If an altitude is drawn from the right angle of any right triangle then the two triangles formed are similar to the original triangle and all three triangles are similar to each other. You are probably familiar with the arithmetic mean which divides the sum of numbers by n. This is commonly used to determine the average test score for group of students. The geometric mean is different sort of average which takes the th root of the product of numbers. In this text we will primarily compare two numbers so we would be taking the square root of the product of two numbers. This mean is commonly used with rates of increase or decrease. Geometric Mean: The geometric mean of two positive numbers and is the number such that and ab. Geometric Mean Theorem 1: In right triangle the altitude drawn from the right angle to the hypotenuse divides the hypotenuse into two segments. The length of the altitude is the geometric mean of these two segments. In other AC words BC AC DC Geometric Mean Theorem 2: In right triangle the altitude drawn from the right angle to the hypotenuse divides the hypotenuse into two segments. The length of each leg of the right triangle is the geometric mean of the lengths of AB DC AD the hypotenuse and the segment of the hypotenuse that is adjacent to the leg. In other words BC AB DB and AD DB Both of these theorems are proved using similar triangles. If two objects are similar they are the same shape but not necessarily the same size.

What if you were given an isosceles right triangle and the length of one of its sides? How could you figure out the lengths of its other sides? After completing this Concept youll be able to use the 45-45-90 Theorem to solve problems like this one. There are two types of special right triangles based on their angle measures. The first is an isosceles right triangle. Here the legs are congruent and by the Base Angles Theorem the base angles will also be congruent. Therefore the angle measures will be 90 45 and 45 You will also hear an isosceles right triangle called 45-45-90 triangle. Because the three angles are always the same all isosceles right triangles are similar. Investigation: Properties of an Isosceles Right Triangle Tools Needed: Pencil paper compass ruler protractor 1.

Step in the above investigation proves the 45-45-90 Triangle Theorem. So anytime you have right triangle with congruent legs or congruent angles then the sides will always be in the ratio 2. The hypotenuse is always because that is the longest length. This is specific case of the Pythagorean Theorem so it will still work if for some reason you forget this corollary. right triangle is triangle with 90 angle. 45-45-90 triangle is right triangle with angle measures of 45 45 and 90 ,Right triangle|Right triangle|Right triangle|Right triangle|Right triangle|Right triangle|Right triangle|Right triangle|Right triangle|Right triangle|Right triangle|Right triangle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Congruence (geometry)|Similarity (geometry)|Similarity (geometry)|Special right triangles|Special right triangles|Special right triangles|Special right triangles|Special right triangles|Special right triangles|Special right triangles|Special right triangles|Special right triangles|Special right triangles|Special right triangles|Special right triangles|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Isosceles triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Pythagorean theorem|Pythagorean theorem

What if you were given 30-60-90 right triangle and the length of one of its side? How could you figure out the lengths of its other sides? After completing this Concept youll be able to use the 30-60-90 Theorem to solve problems like this one. One of the special right triangles is called 30-60-90 triangle after its three angles. To construct 30-60-90 triangle start with an equilateral triangle. Investigation: Properties of 30-60-90 Triangle Tools Needed: Pencil paper ruler compass 1.

84,84,8.6,30-60-90 Right Triangles,438,Here youll learn what the three trigonometric ratios are and how to find their value for right triangles non-right angle. What if you were given right triangle and told that its sides measure and inches? How could you find the sine cosine and tangent of one of the triangles non-right angles? After completing this Concept youll be able to solve for these trigonometric ratios. The word trigonometry comes from two words meaning trianglemeasure. In this lesson we will define three trigonometric (or trig) functions. Trigonometry: The study of the relationships between the sides and angles of right triangles. In trigonometry sides are named in reference to particular angle. The hypotenuse of triangle is always the same but the terms adjacent and opposite depend on which angle you are referencing. side adjacent to an angle is the leg of the triangle that helps form the angle. side opposite to an angle is the leg of the triangle that does not help form the angle. We never reference the right angle when referring to trig ratios. The three basic trig ratios are called sine cosine and tangent. At this point we will only take the sine cosine and tangent of acute angles. However you will learn that you can use these ratios with obtuse angles as well. Sine Ratio: For an acute angle in right triangle the sin is equal to the ratio of the side opposite the angle over the hypotenuse of the triangle. Using the triangle above sin ac and sin bc Cosine Ratio: For an acute angle in right triangle the cos is equal to the ratio of the side adjacent to the angle over the hypotenuse of the triangle.Using the triangle above cos bc and cos ac Tangent Ratio: For an acute angle in right triangle the tan is equal to the ratio of the side opposite to the angle over the side adjacent to x. Using the triangle above tan and tan ba There are few important things to note about the way we write these ratios. First keep in mind that the abbreviations sin cos and tan are all functions. Second be careful when using the abbreviations that you still pronounce the full name of each function. When we write sin it is still pronounced sine with long i. When we write cos we still say co-sine. And when we write tan we still say tangent. An easy way to remember ratios is to use the pneumonic SOH-CAH-TOA. few important points: Always reduce ratios when you can. Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the missing side (if there is one). The tangent ratio can be bigger than (the other two cannot). If two right triangles are similar then their sine cosine and tangent ratios will be the same (because they will reduce to the same ratio). If there is radical in the denominator rationalize the denominator. The sine cosine and tangent for an angle are fixed. Trigonometry is the study of the relationships between the sides and angles of right triangles. The legs are called adjacent or opposite depending on which acute angle is being used. The three trigonometric (or trig) ratios are sine cosine and tangent. ,Right triangle|Right triangle|Right triangle|Right triangle|Right triangle|Right triangle|Right triangle|Right triangle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Congruence (geometry)|Congruence (geometry)|Congruence (geometry)|Right angle|Similarity (geometry)|Special right triangles|Special right triangles|Special right triangles|Special right triangles|Special right triangles|Special right triangles|Special right triangles|Special right triangles|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Tangent|Tangent|Tangent|Tangent|Tangent|Tangent|Tangent|Tangent|Tangent|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Pythagorean theorem|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions

After completing this Concept youll be able to solve problems like this one. The trigonometric ratios are not dependent on the exact side lengths but the angles. There is one fixed value for every angle from to 90 Your scientific (or graphing) calculator knows the values of the sine cosine and tangent of all of these angles. Depending on your calculator you should have SIN COS and TAN buttons. Use these to find the sine cosine and tangent of any acute angle. One application of the trigonometric ratios is to use them to find the missing sides of right triangle. All you need is one angle other than the right angle and one side. Trigonometry is the study of the relationships between the sides and angles of right triangles. The legs are called adjacent or opposite depending on which acute angle is being used.

After completing this Concept youll be able to use trigonometry to solve this problem. practical application of the trigonometric functions is to find the measure of lengths that you cannot measure. Very frequently angles of depression and elevation are used in these types of problems. Angle of Depression: The angle measured from the horizon or horizontal line down. Angle of Elevation: The angle measure from the horizon or horizontal line up. Trigonometry is the study of the relationships between the sides and angles of right triangles. The legs are called adjacent or opposite depending on which acute angle is being used. The three trigonometric (or trig) ratios are sine cosine and tangent.

What if you were told that the longest escalator in North America is at the Wheaton Metro Station in Maryland and is 230 feet long and is 115 ft high? What is the angle of elevation of this escalator? After completing this Concept youll be able use inverse trigonometry to answer this question. The word inverse is probably familiar to you. In mathematics once you learn how to do an operation you also learn how to undo it. For example you may remember that addition and subtraction are considered inverse operations. Multiplication and division are also inverse operations. In algebra you used inverse operations to solve equations and inequalities. When we apply the word inverse to the trigonometric ratios we can find the acute angle measures within right triangle. Normally if you are given an angle and side of right triangle you can find the other two sides using sine cosine or tangent. With the inverse trig ratios you can find the angle measure given two sides. Inverse Tangent: If you know the opposite side and adjacent side of an angle in right triangle you can use inverse tangent to find the measure of the angle. Inverse tangent is also called arctangent and is labeled tan or arctan. The -1 indicates inverse. Inverse Sine: If you know the opposite side of an angle and the hypotenuse in right triangle you can use inverse sine to find the measure of the angle. Inverse sine is also called arcsine and is labeled sin or arcsin. Inverse Cosine: If you know the adjacent side of an angle and the hypotenuse in right triangle you can use inverse cosine to find the measure of the angle. Inverse cosine is also called arccosine and is labeled cos or arccos. Using the triangle below the inverse trigonometric ratios look like this: In order to actually find the measure of the angles you will need you use your calculator. On most scientific and graphing calculators the buttons look like SIN COS and TAN Typically you might have to hit shift or nd button to access these functions. For example on the TI-83 and 84 nd SIN is SIN Again make sure the mode is in degrees. Now that we know how to use inverse trigonometric ratios to find the measure of the acute angles in right triangle we can solve right triangles. To solve right triangle you would need to find all sides and angles in right triangle using any method. When solving right triangle you could use sine cosine or tangent inverse sine inverse cosine or inverse tangent or the Pythagorean Theorem. Remember when solving right triangles to only use the values that you are given. Trigonometry is the study of the relationships between the sides and angles of right triangles. The legs are called adjacent or opposite depending on which acute angle is being used. The three trigonometric (or trig) ratios are sine cosine and tangent.

91,91,9.2,Tangent Lines,470,Here youll learn two theorems about tangent lines and how to apply them. What if line were drawn outside circle that appeared to touch the circle at only one point? How could you determine if that line were actually tangent? After completing this Concept youll be able to apply theorems to solve tangent problems like this one. The tangent line and the radius drawn to the point of tangency have unique relationship. Lets investigate it here. Investigation: Tangent Line and Radius Property Tools needed: compass ruler pencil paper protractor 1. Using your compass draw circle. Locate the center and draw radius. Label the radius AB with as the center. 2. Draw tangent line BC where is the point of tangency. To draw tangent line take your ruler and line it up with point B. Make sure that is the only point on the circle that the line passes through. 3. Using your protractor find ABC. Tangent to Circle Theorem: line is tangent to circle if and only if the line is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. To prove this theorem the easiest way to do so is indirectly (proof by contradiction). Also notice that this theorem uses the words if and only if making it biconditional statement. Therefore the converse of this theorem is also true. Now lets look at two tangent segments drawn from the same external point. If we were to measure these two segments we would find that they are equal. Two Tangents Theorem: If two tangent segments are drawn from the same external point then the segments are equal. circle is the set of all points that are the same distance away from specific point called the center. radius is the distance from the center to the outer rim of circle. diameter is chord that passes through the center of the circle.

92,92,9.3,Arcs in Circles,478,Here youll learn the properties of arcs and central angles of circles and how to apply them. What if the Ferris wheel below had equally spaced seats such that the central angle were 20 How many seats are there? Why do you think it is important to have equally spaced seats on Ferris wheel? If the radius of this Ferris wheel is 25 ft. how far apart are two adjacent seats? Round your answer to the nearest tenth. The shortest distance between two points is straight line. central angle is the angle formed by two radii of the circle with its vertex at the center of the circle. In the picture below the central angle would be BAC. Every central angle divides circle into two arcs (an arc is section of the and BDC. Notice the arc above the letters. To label an arc always use this curve circle). In this case the arcs are BC above the letters. Do not confuse BC and BC. and BDC. There are 360 in If was not on the circle we would not be able to tell the difference between BC 180 circle where semicircle is half of circle or 180 EFG 180 because it is straight angle so EHG 180 and EJG Semicircle: An arc that measures 180 Minor Arc: An arc that is less than 180 Major Arc: An arc that is greater than 180 Always use letters to label major arc. Two arcs are congruent if their central angles are congruent. The measure of the arc formed by two adjacent arcs is the sum of the measures of the two arcs (Arc Addition Postulate). An arc can be measured in degrees or in linear measure (cm ft etc.). In this chapter we will use degree measure. The measure of the minor arc is the same as the measure of the central angle that corresponds to it. The measure of the major arc equals to 360 minus the measure of the minor arc. In order to prevent confusion major arcs are always named with three letters the letters that denote the endpoints of the arc and any other point on the major arc. When referring to the measure of an arc always place an in from of the label. circle is the set of all points that are the same distance away from specific point called the center. An arc is section of the circle. semicircle is an arc that measures 180 central angle is the angle formed by two radii with its vertex at the center of the circle. minor arc is an arc that is less than 180 major arc is an arc that is greater than 180 ,Space (mathematics)|Space (mathematics)|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Congruence (geometry)|Congruence (geometry)|Congruence (geometry)|Distance|Distance|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Radius|Radius|Radius|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Vertex (geometry)|Vertex (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)
93,93,9.4,Chords in Circles,486,Here youll learn theorems about chords in circles and how to apply them. What if you were asked to geometrically consider the Gran Teatro Falla in Cadiz Andaluca Spain pictured below? This theater was built in 1905 and hosts several plays and concerts. It is an excellent example of circles in architecture. Notice the five windows E. and D. Each window is topped with 240 arc. The gold chord in each circle connects the rectangular portion of the window to the circle. Which chords are congruent? How do you know? After completing this Concept youll be able to use properties of chords to answer questions like these. chord is line segment whose endpoints are on circle. diameter is the longest chord in circle. There are several theorems that explore the properties of chords. Chord Theorem 1: In the same circle or congruent circles minor arcs are congruent if and only if their corre- sponding chords are congruent. Notice the if and only if in the middle of the theorem. This means that Chord Theorem is biconditional statement. Taking this theorem one step further any time two central angles are congruent the chords and arcs from the endpoints of the sides of the central angles are also congruent. In both of these pictures BE CD and BE CD. In the second picture we have 4BAE 4CAD because the central angles are congruent and BA AC AD AE because they are all radii (SAS). By CPCTC BE CD. Investigation: Perpendicular Bisector of Chord Tools Needed: paper pencil compass ruler 1. 2. 3. 4. Chapter 9. Circles Draw circle. Label the center A. Draw chord in A. Label it BC. Find the midpoint of BC by using ruler. Label it D. Connect and to form diameter. How does AD relate to the chord BC? Chord Theorem 2: The perpendicular bisector of chord is also diameter. In the picture to the left ADBC and BD DC. From this theorem we also notice that AD also bisects the corresponding arc at so BE EC. Chord Theorem 3: If diameter is perpendicular to chord then the diameter bisects the chord and its corre- sponding arc. Investigation: Properties of Congruent Chords Tools Needed: pencil paper compass ruler 1. Draw circle with radius of inches and two chords that are both inches. Label as in the picture to the right. This diagram is drawn to scale. 2. From the center draw the perpendicular segment to AB and CD. 1. Erase the arc marks and lines beyond the points of intersection leaving FE and EG. Find the measure of these segments. What do you notice? Chord Theorem 4: In the same circle or congruent circles two chords are congruent if and only if they are equidistant from the center. Recall that two lines are equidistant from the same point if and only if the shortest distance from the point to the line is congruent. The shortest distance from any point to line is the perpendicular line between them. In this theorem the fact that FE EG means that AB and CD are equidistant to the center and AB CD. circle is the set of all points that are the same distance away from specific point called the center. radius is the distance from the center to the outer rim of circle. chord is line segment whose endpoints are on circle. diameter is chord that passes through the center of the circle. ,Scaling (geometry)|Angle|Angle|Angle|Rectangle|Distance|Distance|Distance|Distance|Distance|Distance|Distance|Geometry|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Radius|Radius|Radius|Midpoint|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Diameter|Diameter|Diameter|Diameter|Diameter|Diameter|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Arc (geometry)|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment|Line segment|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Bisection|Chord (geometry)|Chord (geometry)|Chord (geometry)|Chord (geometry)|Chord (geometry)|Chord (geometry)|Chord (geometry)|Chord (geometry)|Chord (geometry)|Chord (geometry)|Chord (geometry)|Chord (geometry)|Chord (geometry)|Chord (geometry)|Chord (geometry)|Chord (geometry)|Chord (geometry)|Chord (geometry)|Chord (geometry)|Chord (geometry)|Chord (geometry)|Chord (geometry)|Chord (geometry)|Chord (geometry)|Chord (geometry)|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular
94,94,9.5,Inscribed Angles in Circles,495,Here youll learn the properties of inscribed angles and how to apply them. What if your family went to Washington DC over the summer and saw the White House? The closest you can get to the White House are the walking trails on the far right. You got as close as you could (on the trail) to the fence to take picture (you were not allowed to walk on the grass). Where else could you have taken your picture from to get the same frame of the White House? Where do you think the best place to stand would be? Your line of sight in the camera is marked in the picture as the grey lines. The white dotted arcs do not actually exist but were added to help with this problem. An inscribed angle is an angle with its vertex is the circle and its sides contain chords. The intercepted arc is the arc that is on the interior of the inscribed angle and whose endpoints are on the angle. The vertex of an inscribed angle can be anywhere on the circle as long as its sides intersect the circle to form an intercepted arc. Lets investigate the relationship between the inscribed angle the central angle and the arc they intercept. Investigation: Measuring an Inscribed Angle Tools Needed: pencil paper compass ruler protractor 1. Draw three circles with three different inscribed angles. For make one side of the inscribed angle diameter for make inside the angle and for make outside the angle. Try to make all the angles different sizes. 2. Using your ruler draw in the corresponding central angle for each angle and label each set of endpoints. 3. Using your protractor measure the six angles and determine if there is relationship between the central angle the inscribed angle and the intercepted arc. LAM NBP LM NP QCR QR LKM NOP QSR Inscribed Angle Theorem: The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. If we had drawn in the central angle ABC we could also say that ADC In the picture ADC 12 AC. ABC because the measure of the central angle is equal to the measure of the intercepted arc. To prove the Inscribed Angle Theorem you would need to split it up into three cases like the three different angles drawn from the Investigation. Congruent Inscribed Angle Theorem: Inscribed angles that intercept the same arc are congruent. Inscribed Angle Semicircle Theorem: An angle that intercepts semicircle is right angle. In the Inscribed Angle Semicircle Theorem we could also say that the angle is inscribed in semicircle. Anytime right angle is inscribed in circle the endpoints of the angle are the endpoints of diameter. Therefore the converse of the Inscribed Angle Semicircle Theorem is also true. circle is the set of all points that are the same distance away from specific point called the center. radius is the distance from the center to the circle. chord is line segment whose endpoints are on circle. diameter is chord that passes through the center of the circle.

100,100,9.11,Segments from Secants and Tangents,533,Here youll learn how to solve for missing segments created by tangent line and secant line intersecting outside circle. What if you were given circle with tangent and secant that intersect outside the circle? How could you use the length of some of the segments formed by their intersection to determine the lengths of the unknown segments? After completing this Concept youll be able to use the Tangent Secant Segment Theorem to solve problems like this one. If tangent and secant meet at common point outside circle the segments created have similar relationship to that of two secant rays. Recall that the product of the outer portion of secant and the whole is equal to the same of the other secant. If one of these segments is tangent it will still be the product of the outer portion and the whole. However for tangent line the outer portion and the whole are equal. Tangent Secant Segment Theorem: If tangent and secant are drawn from common point outside the circle (and the segments are labeled like the picture to the left) then b(b c). This means that the product of the outside segment of the secant and the whole is equal to the square of the tangent segment. circle is the set of all points that are the same distance away from specific point called the center. radius is the distance from the center to the circle. chord is line segment whose endpoints are on circle. diameter is chord that passes through the center of the circle.

From the Pythagorean Theorem the equation of circle centered at the origin is The center does not always have to be on (0 0). If it is not then we label the center (h k). We would then use the Distance Formula to find the length of the radius. (x h) (y k) If you square both sides of this equation then you would have the standard equation of circle. The standard equation of circle with center (h k) and radius is (x h) (y k) circle is the set of all points that are the same distance away from specific point called the center. radius is the distance from the center to the circle. ,Right triangle|Coordinate system|Coordinate system|Coordinate system|Coordinate system|Angle|Distance|Distance|Distance|Distance|Distance|Distance|Distance|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Special right triangles|Radius|Radius|Radius|Radius|Radius|Radius|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Square|Two-dimensional space|Two-dimensional space|Two-dimensional space|Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinate system|Triangle|Pythagorean theorem

Polygons are similar when the corresponding angles are equal and the corresponding sides are in the same proportion. The scale factor for the sides of two similar polygons is the same as the ratio of the perimeters. In fact the ratio of any part of two similar shapes (diagonals medians midsegments altitudes etc.) is the same as the scale factor. The ratio of the areas is the square of the scale factor. An easy way to remember this is to think about the units of area which are always squared. Therefore you would always square the scale factor to get the ratio of the areas.

After completing this Concept youll be able to answer questions like this. Recall that is the ratio between the circumference of circle and its diameter. We are going to use the formula for circumference to derive the formula for area. First take circle and divide it up into several wedges or sectors.

What is the total distance across the pentagon? Round your answer to the nearest hundredth. After completing this Concept youll be able to answer questions like this. regular polygon is polygon with congruent sides and angles. Recall that the perimeter of square is times the length of side because each side is congruent. We can extend this concept to any regular polygon. Perimeter of Regular Polygon: If the length of side is and there are sides in regular polygon then the perimeter is ns. In order to find the area of regular polygon we need to define some new terminology. First all regular polygons can be inscribed in circle. So regular polygons have center and radius which are the center and radius of the circumscribed circle. Also like circle regular polygon will have central angle formed. In regular polygon however the central angle is the angle formed by two radii drawn to consecutive vertices of the polygon. In the picture below the central angle is BAD. Also notice that 4BAD is an isosceles triangle. Every regular polygon with sides is formed by isosceles triangles. The height of these isosceles triangles is called the apothem. The area of each triangle is bh 12 sa where is the length of side and is the apothem. If there are sides in the regular polygon then it is made up of congruent triangles.

What if you were given solid three-dimensional figure like carton of ice cream? How could you determine how the faces vertices and edges of that figure are related? After completing this Concept youll be able to use Eulers Theorem to answer that question. polyhedron is 3-dimensional figure that is formed by polygons that enclose region in space. Each polygon in polyhedron is called face. The line segment where two faces intersect is called an edge and the point of intersection of two edges is vertex. There are no gaps between the edges or vertices in polyhedron. Examples of polyhedrons include cube prism or pyramid. Non-polyhedrons are cones spheres and cylinders because they have sides that are not polygons. prism is polyhedron with two congruent bases in parallel planes and the lateral sides are rectangles. Prisms are explored in further detail in another Concept. pyramid is polyhedron with one base and all the lateral sides meet at common vertex. The lateral sides are triangles. Pyramids are explored in further detail in another Concept. All prisms and pyramids are named by their bases. So the first prism would be triangular prism and the second would be an octagonal prism. The first pyramid would be hexagonal pyramid and the second would be square pyramid. The lateral faces of pyramid are always triangles. Eulers Theorem states that the number of faces (F) vertices (V and edges (E) of polyhedron can be related such that +V 2. regular polyhedron is polyhedron where all the faces are congruent regular polygons. There are five regular polyhedra called the Platonic solids after the Greek philosopher Plato. These five solids are significant because they are the only five regular polyhedra. There are only five because the sum of the measures of the angles that meet at each vertex must be less than 360 Therefore the only combinations are or triangles at each vertex squares at each vertex or pentagons. Each of these polyhedra have name based on the number of sides except the cube. Regular Tetrahedron: 4-faced polyhedron where all the faces are equilateral triangles. Cube: 6-faced polyhedron where all the faces are squares. Regular Octahedron: An 8-faced polyhedron where all the faces are equilateral triangles. Regular Dodecahedron: 12-faced polyhedron where all the faces are regular pentagons. Regular Icosahedron: 20-faced polyhedron where all the faces are equilateral triangles. polyhedron is 3-dimensional figure that is formed by polygons that enclose region in space. Each polygon in polyhedron is face. The line segment where two faces intersect is an edge.

What if your family were ready to fill the new pool with water and they didnt know how much water would be needed? The shallow end is ft. and the deep end is ft. The pool is 10 ft. wide by 25 ft. long. How many gallons of water will it take to fill the pool? There are approximately 7.48 gallons in cubic foot. After completing this Concept youll be able to answer this question. prism is 3-dimensional figure with congruent bases in parallel planes with rectangular lateral faces. The edges between the lateral faces are called lateral edges. All prisms are named by their bases so the prism below is pentagonal prism. This particular prism is called right prism because the lateral faces are perpendicular to the bases. Oblique prisms lean to one side or the other and the height is outside the prism. Surface Area Surface area is the sum of the areas of the faces of solid. Surface Area of Right Prism: The surface area of right prism is the sum of the area of the bases and the area of each rectangular lateral face. Volume Volume is the measure of how much space three-dimensional figure occupies. The basic unit of volume is the cubic unit: cubic centimeter (cm cubic inch (in cubic meter (m cubic foot etc. Each basic cubic unit has measure of one for each: length width and height. Volume of Rectangular Prism: If rectangular prism is units high units wide and units long then its volume is h. If we further analyze the formula for the volume of rectangular prism we would see that is equal to the area of the base of the prism rectangle. If the bases are not rectangles this would still be true however we would have to rewrite the equation little. Volume of Prism: If the area of the base of prism is and the height is then the volume is h. Recall that earlier in this Concept we talked about oblique prisms. These are prisms that lean to one side and the height is outside the prism. What would be the area of an oblique prism? To answer this question we need to introduce Cavalieris Principle. Cavalieris Principle: If two solids have the same height and the same cross-sectional area at every level then they will have the same volume. Basically if an oblique prism and right prism have the same base area and height then they will have the same volume. prism is 3-dimensional figure with congruent bases in parallel planes and in which the other faces are rectangles. The non-base faces are lateral faces. The edges between the lateral faces are lateral edges. right prism is prism where all the lateral faces are perpendicular to the bases. An oblique prism is prism that leans to one side and whose height is perpendicular to the bases plane. Surface area is two-dimensional measurement that is the sum of the area of the faces of solid. Volume is three-dimensional measurement that is measure of how much three-dimensional space solid occupies. ,Face (geometry)|Face (geometry)|Face (geometry)|Face (geometry)|Face (geometry)|Face (geometry)|Face (geometry)|Face (geometry)|Face (geometry)|Face (geometry)|Face (geometry)|Space (mathematics)|Space (mathematics)|Congruence (geometry)|Rectangle|Rectangle|Rectangle|Rectangle|Rectangle|Rectangle|Rectangle|Rectangle|Pentagon|Edge (geometry)|Edge (geometry)|Edge (geometry)|Edge (geometry)|Edge (geometry)|Edge (geometry)|Edge (geometry)|Edge (geometry)|Edge (geometry)|Edge (geometry)|Edge (geometry)|Edge (geometry)|Edge (geometry)|Edge (geometry)|Edge (geometry)|Cross section (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Vertex (geometry)|Vertex (geometry)|Vertex (geometry)|Vertex (geometry)|Vertex (geometry)|Vertex (geometry)|Vertex (geometry)|Vertex (geometry)|Vertex (geometry)|Vertex (geometry)|Vertex (geometry)|Altitude (triangle)|Altitude (triangle)|Altitude (triangle)|Altitude (triangle)|Altitude (triangle)|Altitude (triangle)|Altitude (triangle)|Prism (geometry)|Prism (geometry)|Prism (geometry)|Prism (geometry)|Prism (geometry)|Prism (geometry)|Prism (geometry)|Prism (geometry)|Prism (geometry)|Prism (geometry)|Prism (geometry)|Prism (geometry)|Prism (geometry)|Prism (geometry)|Prism (geometry)|Prism (geometry)|Prism (geometry)|Prism (geometry)|Prism (geometry)|Prism (geometry)|Prism (geometry)|Prism (geometry)|Prism (geometry)|Prism (geometry)|Prism (geometry)|Prism (geometry)|Prism (geometry)|Prism (geometry)|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Parallel (geometry)|Parallel (geometry)
119,119,11.4,Cylinders,625,Here youll learn how to calculate the surface area and volume of cylinders. What if you wanted to figure out how much paper you needed for the label of can? How could you use the surface area of cylinder to help you? After completing this Concept youll be able to answer questions like this one. cylinder is solid with congruent circular bases that are in parallel planes. The space between the circles is enclosed. Just like circle the cylinder has radius for each of the circular bases. Also like prism cylinder can be oblique like the one to the right. Surface Area Surface area is the sum of the areas of the faces. Lets find the net of right cylinder. One way for you to do this is to take label off of soup can or can of vegetables. When you take this label off we see that it is rectangle where the height is the height of the cylinder and the base is the circumference of the base. This rectangle and the two circular bases make up the net of cylinder. From the net we can see that the surface area of right cylinder is 2r {z area of 2r |{z} length both of circles rectangle Surface Area of Right Cylinder: If is the radius of the base and is the height of the cylinder then the surface area is SA 2r 2rh. To see an animation of the surface area click http:www.rkm.com.auANIMATIONSanimation-Cylinder-Surface- Area-Derivation.html by Russell Knightley. Volume Volume is the measure of how much space three-dimensional figure occupies. The basic unit of volume is the cubic unit: cubic centimeter (cm cubic inch (in cubic meter (m cubic foot etc. Each basic cubic unit has measure of one for each: length width and height. The volume of cylinder is (r )h where is the area of the base. Volume of Cylinder: If the height of cylinder is and the radius is then the volume would be h. If an oblique cylinder has the same base area and height as another cylinder then it will have the same volume. This is due to Cavalieris Principle which states that if two solids have the same height and the same cross-sectional area at every level then they will have the same volume. cylinder is solid with congruent circular bases that are in parallel planes. The space between the circles is enclosed. cylinder has radius and height and can also be oblique (slanted).

120,120,11.5,Pyramids,630,Here youll learn how to calculate the surface area and volume of pyramid. What if you wanted to know the volume of an Egyptian Pyramid? The Khafre Pyramid is the second largest pyramid of the Ancient Egyptian Pyramids in Giza. It is square pyramid with base edge of 706 feet and an original height of 407.5 feet. What was the original volume of the Khafre Pyramid? After completing this Concept youll be able to answer this question. pyramid has one base and all the lateral faces meet at common vertex. The edges between the lateral faces are lateral edges. The edges between the base and the lateral faces are called base edges. If we were to draw the height of the pyramid to the right it would be off to the left side. When pyramid has height that is directly in the center of the base the pyramid is said to be regular. These pyramids have regular polygon as the base. All regular pyramids also have slant height that is the height of lateral face. Because of the nature of regular pyramids all slant heights are congruent. non-regular pyramid does not have slant height. Surface Area Using the slant height which is usually labeled the area of each triangular face is bl. Surface Area of Regular Pyramid: If is the area of the base and is the perimeter of the base and is the slant height then SA 12 Pl. If you ever forget this formula use the net. Each triangular face is congruent plus the area of the base. This way you do not have to remember formula just process which is the same as finding the area of prism. Volume Recall that the volume of prism is Bh where is the area of the base. The volume of pyramid is closely related to the volume of prism with the same sized base. Investigation: Finding the Volume of Pyramid Tools needed: pencil paper scissors tape ruler dry rice or sand. 1. Make an open net (omit one base) of cube with inch sides. 2. Cut out the net and tape up the sides to form an open cube. 3. Make an open net (no base) of square pyramid with lateral edges of 2.45 inches and base edges of inches. This will make the overall height inches. 4. Cut out the net and tape up the sides to form an open pyramid. 5. Fill the pyramid with dry rice. Then dump the rice into the open cube. How many times do you have to repeat this to fill the cube? Volume of Pyramid: If is the area of the base and is the height then the volume of pyramid is 13 Bh. The investigation showed us that you would need to repeat this process three times to fill the cube. This means that the pyramid is one-third the volume of prism with the same base. pyramid is solid with one base and lateral faces that meet at common vertex. The edges between the lateral faces are lateral edges. The edges between the base and the lateral faces are base edges. regular pyramid is pyramid where the base is regular polygon. All regular pyramids also have slant height which is the height of lateral face. Surface area is two-dimensional measurement that is the total area of all surfaces that bound solid.

After completing this Concept youll be able to answer questions like these. cone is solid with circular base and sides taper up towards common vertex. It is said that cone is generated from rotating right triangle around one leg in circle. Notice that cone has slant height just like pyramid. Surface Area We know that the base is circle but we need to find the formula for the curved side that tapers up from the base. Unfolding cone we have the net: From this we can see that the lateral faces edge is 2r and the sector of circle with radius l. We can find the area of the sector by setting up proportion. Area circle Circum erence Area sector Arc length 2l Area sector 2r Cross multiply: l(Area sector) rl Area sector rl Surface Area of Right Cone: The surface area of right cone with slant height and base radius is SA rl.

What if you were asked to geometrically consider bowling ball? regulation bowling ball is sphere that weighs between 12 and 16 pounds. The maximum circumference of bowling ball is 27 inches. Using this number find the radius surface area and volume of the bowling ball. You may assume the bowling ball does not have any finger holes. Round your answers to the nearest hundredth. After completing this Concept youll be able to answer questions like these. sphere is the set of all points in three-dimensional space which are equidistant from point. You can think of sphere as three-dimensional circle. sphere has center radius and diameter just like circle. The radius has an endpoint on the sphere and the other is on the center. The diameter must contain the center. If it does not it is chord. The great circle is plane that contains the diameter. It is the largest circle cross section in sphere. There are infinitely many great circles. The circumference of sphere is the circumference of great circle. Every great circle divides sphere into two congruent hemispheres or two half spheres. Also like circle spheres can have tangent lines and secants. These are defined just like they are in circle. Surface Area Surface area is two-dimensional measurement that is the total area of all surfaces that bound solid. The basic unit of area is the square unit. One way to find the formula for the surface area of sphere is to look at baseball. We can best approximater so the surface area of sphere is 4r While the covers of baseball are not four perfect circles they are stretched and skewed. Another way to show the surface area of sphere is to watch the link by Russell Knightley http:www.rkm.com.a uANIMATIONSanimation-Sphere-Surface-Area-Derivation.html. It is great visual interpretation of the formula. Surface Area of Sphere: If is the radius then the surface area of sphere is SA 4r Volume To find the volume of any solid you must figure out how much space it occupies. The basic unit of volume is the cubic unit. sphere can be thought of as regular polyhedron with an infinite number of congruent regular polygon faces. As the number of faces increases to an infinite number the figure approaches becoming sphere. So sphere can be thought of as polyhedron with an infinite number faces. Each of those faces is the base of pyramid whose vertex is located at the center of the sphere. Each of the pyramids that make up the sphere would be congruent to the pyramid shown. The volume of this pyramid is given by 13 Bh. To find the volume of the sphere you need to add up the volumes of an infinite number of infinitely small pyramids. (all pyramids) +V +V +V (B h) h(B The sum of all of the bases of the pyramids is the surface area of the sphere. Since you know that the surface area of the sphere is 4r you can substitute this quantity into the equation above. 4r In the picture above we can see that the height of each pyramid is the radius so r. r(r To see an animation of the volume of sphere see http:www.rkm.com.auANIMATIONSanimation-Sphere-Vo lume-Derivation.html by Russell Knightley. It is slightly different interpretation than our derivation.

Two solids are similar if and only if they are the same type of solid and their corresponding linear measures (radii heights base lengths etc.) are proportional. Surface Area Recall that when two shapes are similar the ratio of the area is square of the scale factor. For example the two rectangles above are similar because their sides are in ratio of 5:8. The area of the larger rectangle is 8(16) 128 units and the area of the smaller rectangle is 5(10) 50 units If we compare the areas in ratio it is 50 128 25 64 Surface Area Ratio: If two solids are similar with scale factor of then the surface areas are in ratio of ab Volume Lets look at what we know about similar solids so far.

Atransformation is an operation that moves flips or changes figure to create new figure. rigid transforma- tion is transformation that preserves size and shape. The rigid transformations are: translations (discussed here) reflections and rotations. The new figure created by transformation is called the image. The original figure is called the preimage. Another word for rigid transformation is an isometry. Rigid transformations are also called congruence transformations. If the preimage is then the image would be labeled said prime. If there is an image of that would be labeled 00 said double prime. translation is transformation that moves every point in figure the same distance in the same direction. In the coordinate plane we say that translation moves figure units and units. Another way to write translation rule is to use vectors. vector is quantity that has direction and size. In the graph below the line from to or the distance traveled is the vector. This vector would be labeled AB because is the initial point and is the terminal point. The terminal point always has the arrow pointing towards it and has the half-arrow over it in the label. The component form of AB combines the horizontal distance traveled and the vertical distance traveled. We write the component form of AB as h3 7i because AB travels units to the right and units up.

Another word for rigid transformation is an isometry. Rigid transformations are also called congruence transformations. If the preimage is then the image would be labeled said prime. If there is an image of that would be labeled 00 said double prime. rotation is transformation by which figure is turned around fixed point to create an image. The center of rotation is the fixed point that figure is rotated around. Lines can be drawn from the preimage to the center of rotation and from the center of rotation to the image. The angle formed by these lines is the angle of rotation. In this Concept our center of rotation will always be the origin. Rotations can also be clockwise or counterclock- wise. We will only do counterclockwise rotations to go along with the way the quadrants are numbered. Investigation: Drawing Rotation of 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. www.ck12.org Draw 4ABC and point outside the circle. Draw the line segment RB. Take your protractor place the center on and the initial side on RB. Mark 100 angle. Find such that RB RB Repeat steps 2-4 with points and C. Connect and to form 4A This is the process you would follow to rotate any figure 100 counterclockwise. If it was different angle measure then in Step you would mark different angle. You will need to repeat steps 2-4 for every vertex of the shape. Common Rotations Rotation of 180 If (x y) is rotated 180 around the origin then the image will be (x y). Rotation of 90 If (x y) is rotated 90 around the origin then the image will be (y x). Rotation of 270 If (x y) is rotated 270 around the origin then the image will be (y x). While we can rotate any image any amount of degrees only 90 180 and 270 have special rules. To rotate figure by an angle measure other than these three you must use the process from the Investigation. transformation is an operation that moves flips or otherwise changes figure to create new figure. rigid transformation (also known as an isometry or congruence transformation) is transformation that does not change the size or shape of figure. The new figure created by transformation is called the image. The original figure is called the preimage. rotation is transformation where figure is turned around fixed point to create an image. The lines drawn from the preimage to the center of rotation and from the center of rotation to the image form the angle of rotation. ,Translation (geometry)|Rotation (mathematics)|Rotation (mathematics)|Rotation (mathematics)|Rotation (mathematics)|Rotation (mathematics)|Rotation (mathematics)|Rotation (mathematics)|Rotation (mathematics)|Rotation (mathematics)|Rotation (mathematics)|Rotation (mathematics)|Rotation (mathematics)|Rotation (mathematics)|Rotation (mathematics)|Rotation (mathematics)|Rotation (mathematics)|Rotation (mathematics)|Rotation (mathematics)|Rotation (mathematics)|Rotation (mathematics)|Rotation (mathematics)|Rotation (mathematics)|Rotation (mathematics)|Rotation (mathematics)|Rotation (mathematics)|Rotation (mathematics)|Rotation (mathematics)|Rotation (mathematics)|Rotation (mathematics)|Rotation (mathematics)|Rotation (mathematics)|Rotation (mathematics)|Coordinate system|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Congruence (geometry)|Congruence (geometry)|Circle|Rigid transformation|Rigid transformation|Rigid transformation|Rigid transformation|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Vertex (geometry)|Reflection (mathematics)|Reflection (mathematics)|Reflection (mathematics)|Line segment|Cartesian coordinate system

Transformations Summary Atransformation is an operation that moves flips or otherwise changes figure to create new figure. rigid transformation (also known as an isometry or congruence transformation) is transformation that does not change the size or shape of figure. The new figure created by transformation is called the image. The original figure is called the preimage. There are three rigid transformations: translations reflections and rotations. Atranslation is transformation that moves every point in figure the same distance in the same direction. rotation is transformation where figure is turned around fixed point to create an image. reflection is transformation that turns figure into its mirror image by flipping it over line. Composition of Transformations composition of transformations is to perform more than one rigid transformation on figure. One of the interesting things about compositions is that they can always be written as one rule. What this means is you dont necessarily have to perform one transformation followed by the next. You can write rule and perform them at the same time. You can compose any transformations but here are some of the most common compositions. 1. Glide Reflection: composition of reflection and translation. The translation is in direction parallel to the line of reflection. 2. Reflections over Parallel Lines Theorem: If you compose two reflections over parallel lines that are units apart it is the same as single translation of 2h units. Be careful with this theorem. Notice it does not say which direction the translation is in. So to apply this theorem you would still need to visualize or even do the reflections to see in which direction the translation would be. 3. Reflection over the Axes Theorem: If you compose two reflections over each axis then the final image is rotation of 180 of the original. With this particular composition order does not matter. Lets look at the angle of intersection for these lines. We know that the axes are perpendicular which means they intersect at 90 angle. The final answer was rotation of 180 which is double 90 Therefore we could say that the composition of the reflections over each axis is rotation of double their angle of intersection. 4. Reflection over Intersecting Lines Theorem: If you compose two reflections over lines that intersect at then the resulting image is rotation of 2x where the center of rotation is the point of intersection. transformation is an operation that moves flips or otherwise changes figure to create new figure. rigid transformation (also known as an isometry or congruence transformation) is transformation that does not change the size or shape of figure. The new figure created by transformation is called the image. The original figure is called the preimage. There are three rigid transformations: translations reflections and rotations. translation is transformation that moves every point in figure the same distance in the same direction. rotation is transformation where figure is turned around fixed point to create an image. reflection is transformation that turns figure into its mirror image by flipping it over line. composition (of transformations) is when more than one transformation is performed on figure. glide reflection is composition of reflection and translation.
