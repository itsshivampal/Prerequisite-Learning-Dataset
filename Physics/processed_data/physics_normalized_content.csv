0,0,1,What is Physics?,3,Physics is the study of the world around us. In sense we are more qualified to do physics than any other science. From the day we are born we study the things around us in an effort to understand how they work and relate to each other. Learning how to catch or throw ball is physics undertaking for example. In the field of study we refer to as physics we just try to make the things everyone has been studying more clear. We attempt to describe them through simple rules and mathematics. Mathematics is merely the language we use. The best approach to physics is to relate everything you learn to things you have already noticed in your everyday life. Sometimes when you look at things closely you discover things you had overlooked intially. It is the continued scrutiny of everything we know about the world around us that leads people to the lifelong study of physics. You can start with asking simple question like Why is the sky blue? which could lead you to electromagnetic waves which in turn could lead you wave particle duality and to energy levels of atoms and before long you are studying quantum mechanics or the structure of the universe. In the sections that follow notice that we will try to describe how we will communicate the things we are dealing with. This is our langauge. Once this is done we can begin the adventure of looking more closely at the world we live in. ntsDescriptions relating to these questions must be included: What is meant by theory? How does hypothesis become part of law? (a) Define the term laboratory. (b) How does your schools physics laboratory fit this definition? Distinguish between science and technology. ,Physics is the study of the world around us. In sense we are more qualified to do Physics than any other science.

4,4,2.2.1,SI Units,9,We will be using the SI units in this course. SI units are the internationally agreed upon units. Historically these units are based on the metric system which was developed in France at the time of the French Revolution. Definition: SI Units The name SI units comes from the French Systeme International dUnites which means international system of units. There are seven base SI units. These are listed in Table 2.1. All physical quantities have units which can be built from these seven base units. These seven units were defined to be the base units. So it is possible to create different set of units by defining different set of base units. These seven units are called base units because none of them can be expressed as combinations of the other six. This is identical to bricks and concrete being the base units of building. You can build different things using different combinations of bricks and concrete. The 26 letters of the alphabet are the base units for language like English. Many different words can be formed by using these letters. ,We will be using the SI units in this course. SI units are the internationally agreed upon units.

5,5,2.2.2,The Other Systems of Units,10,The SI Units are not the only units available but they are most widely used. In Science there are three other sets of units that can also be used. These are mentioned here for interest only. c.g.s Units In the c.g.s. system the metre is replaced by the centimetre and the kilogram is replaced by the gram. This is simple change but it means that all units derived from these two are changed. For example the units of force and work are different. These units are used most often in astrophysics and atomic physics. Imperial Units Imperial units arose when kings and queens decided the measures that were to be used in the land. All the imperial base units except for the measure of time are different to those of SI units. This is the unit system you are most likely to encounter if SI units are not used. Examples of imperial units are pounds miles gallons and yards. These units are used by the Americans and British. As you can imagine having different units in use from place to place makes scientific communication very difficult. This was the motivation for adopting set of internationally agreed upon units. Natural Units This is the most sophisticated choice of units. Here the most fundamental discovered quantities (such as the speed of light) are set equal to 1. The argument for this choice is that all other quantities should be built from these fundamental units. This system of units is used in high energy physics and quantum mechanics. ,The SI Units are not the only units available but they are most widely used.

6,6,2.3,Writing Units as Words or Symbols,10,Unit names are always written with lowercase first letter for example we write metre and litre. The symbols or abbreviations of units are also written with lowercase initials for example for metre and for litre. The exception to this rule is if the unit is named after person then the symbol is capital letter. For example the kelvin was named after Lord Kelvin and its symbol is K. If the abbreviation of the unit that is named after person has two letters the second letter is lowercase for example Hz for hertz. ,Unit names are always written with lowercase first letter for example we write Metre and litre.

7,7,2.4,Combinations of SI Base Units,12,To make working with units easier some combinations of the base units are given special names but it is always correct to reduce everything to the base units. Table 2.2 lists some examples of combinations of SI base units that are assigned special names. Do not be concerned if the formulae look unfamiliar at this stage we will deal with each in detail in the chapters ahead (as well as many others) It is very important that you are able to recognise the units correctly. For instance the new- ton (N) is another name for the kilogram metre per second squared (kgms2) while the kilogram metre squared per second squared (kgm2 s2) is called the joule (J). Important: When writing combinations of base SI units place dot () between the units to indicate that different base units are used. For example the symbol for metres per second is correctly written as ms1 and not as ms1 or ms. ,To make Work (physics) with units easier some combinations of the base units are given special names but it is always correct to reduce everything to the base units.

9,9,2.5.1,Rounding Off,12,Certain numbers may take an infinite amount of paper and ink to write out. Not only is that impossible but writing numbers out to high accuracy (many decimal places) is very inconvenient and rarely gives better answers. For this reason we often estimate the number to certain number of decimal places. Rounding off or approximating decimal number to given number of decimal places is the quickest way to approximate number. For example if you wanted to round-off 26525272 to three decimal places then you would first count three places after the decimal. 2652|5272 All numbers to the right of are ignored after you determine whether the number in the third decimal place must be rounded up or rounded down. You round up the final digit (make the digit one more) if the first digit after the was greater or equal to and round down (leave the digit alone) otherwise. So since the first digit after the is we must round up the digit in the third decimal place to and the final answer of 26525272 rounded to three decimal places is 2653. ,Certain numbers may take an infinite amount of paper and ink to write out.

10,10,2.5.2,Error Margins,13,In calculation that has many steps it is best to leave the rounding off right until the end. For example Jack and Jill walks to school. They walk 09 kilometers to get to school and it takes them 17 minutes. We can calculate their speed in the following two ways. You will see that we get two different answers. In Method no rounding was done but in Method the time was rounded to decimal places. This made big difference to the answer. The answer in Method is more accurate because rounded numbers were not used in the calculation. Always only round off your final answer. ,In calculation that has many steps it is best to leave the rounding off right until the end. For example Jack and Jill walks to school.

11,11,2.5.3,Scientific Notation,13,In Science one often needs to work with very large or very small numbers. These can be written more easily in scientific notation in the general form 10e where is decimal number between and 10 that is rounded off to few decimal places. is known as the exponent and is an integer. If it represents how many times the decimal place in should be moved to the right. If then it represents how many times the decimal place in should be moved to the left. For example 324 103 represents 3240 (the decimal moved three places to the right) and 324 103 represents 000324 (the decimal moved three places to the left). If number must be converted into scientific notation we need to work out how many times the number must be multiplied or divided by 10 to make it into number between and 10 (i.e. the value of e) and what this number between and 10 is (the value of d). We do this by counting the number of decimal places the decimal comma must move. For example write the speed of light in scientific notation to two decimal places. The speed of light is 299 792 458 ms1. First find where the decimal comma must go for two decimal places (to find d) and then count how many places there are after the decimal comma to determine e. In this example the decimal comma must go after the first but since the number after the is 300. because there are digits left after the decimal comma. So the speed of light in scientific notation to two decimal places is 300 108 ms1. ,In Science one often needs to Work (physics) with very large or very small numbers.

12,12,2.5.4,Significant Figures,15,In number each non-zero digit is significant figure. Zeroes are only counted if they are between two non-zero digits or are at the end of the decimal part. For example the number 2000 has significant figure (the 2) but 20000 has significant figures. You estimate number like this by removing significant figures from the number (starting from the right) until you have the desired number of significant figures rounding as you go. For example 6827 has significant figures but if you wish to write it to significant figures it would mean removing the and rounding up so it would be 683. ,In number each non-zero digit is significant figure.

13,13,2.6,Prefixes of Base Units,15,Now that you know how to write numbers in scientific notation another important aspect of units is the prefixes that are used with the units. Definition: Prefix prefix is group of letters that are placed in front of word. The effect of the prefix is to change meaning of the word. For example the prefix un is often added to word to mean not as in unnecessary which means not necessary. In the case of units the prefixes have special use. The kilogram (kg) is simple example. kg is equal to 000 or 103 g. Grouping the 103 and the together we can replace the 103 with the prefix (kilo). Therefore the takes the place of the 103. The kilogram is unique in that it is the only SI base unit containing prefix. In Science all the prefixes used with units are some power of 10. Table 2.4 lists some of these prefixes. You will not use most of these prefixes but those prefixes listed in bold should be learnt. The case of the prefix symbol is very important. Where letter features twice in the table it is written in uppercase for exponents bigger than one and in lowercase for exponents less than one. For example means mega (106) and means milli (103). ,Now that you know how to write numbers in scientific notation another important aspect of units is the prefixes that are used with the units.

14,14,2.7,The Importance of Units,17,Without units much of our work as scientists would be meaningless. We need to express our thoughts clearly and units give meaning to the numbers we measure and calculate. Depending on which units we use the numbers are different. For example if you have 12 water it means nothing. You could have 12 ml of water 12 litres of water or even 12 bottles of water. Units are an essential part of the language we use. Units must be specified when expressing physical quantities. Imagine that you are baking cake but the units like grams and millilitres for the flour milk sugar and baking powder are not specified ,Without units much of our Work (physics) as scientists would be meaningless.

17,17,2.9,A sanity test,19,sanity test is method of checking whether an answer makes sense. All we have to do is to take careful look at our answer and ask the question Does the answer make sense? Imagine you were calculating the number of people in classroom. If the answer you got was 000 000 people you would know it was wrong it is not possible to have that many people in classroom. That is all sanity test is is your answer insane or not? It is useful to have an idea of some numbers before we start. For example let us consider masses. An average person has mass around 70 kg while the heaviest person in medical history had mass of 635 kg. If you ever have to calculate persons mass and you get 000 kg this should fail your sanity check your answer is insane and you must have made mistake somewhere. In the same way an answer of 0.01 kg should fail your sanity test. The only problem with sanity check is that you must know what typical values for things are. For example finding the number of learners in classroom you need to know that there are usually 2050 people in classroom.

18,18,3,Motion in One Dimension,23,,,
19,19,3.1,Introduction,23,This chapter is about how things move in straight line or more scientifically how things move in one dimension. This is useful for learning how to describe the movement of cars along straight road or of trains along straight railway tracks. If you want to understand how any object moves for example car on the freeway soccer ball being kicked towards the goal or your dog chasing the neighbours cat then you have to understand three basic ideas about what it means when something is moving. These three ideas describe different parts of exactly how an object moves. They are: 1. position or displacement which tells us exactly where the object is 2. speed or velocity which tells us exactly how fast the objects position is changing or more familiarly how fast the object is moving and 3. acceleration which tells us exactly how fast the objects velocity is changing. You will also learn how to use position displacement speed velocity and acceleration to describe the motion of simple objects. You will learn how to read and draw graphs that summarise the motion of moving object. You will also learn about the equations that can be used to describe motion and how to apply these equations to objects moving in one dimension. ,This chapter is about how things move in straight line or more scientifically how things move in one dimension.

20,20,3.2,"Reference Point, Frame of Reference and Position",23,The most important idea when studying motion is you have to know where you are. The word position describes your location (where you are). However saying that you are here is meaningless and you have to specify your position relative to known reference point. For example if you are from the doorway inside your classroom then your reference point is the doorway. This defines your position inside the classroom.

For example boy is standing still inside train as it pulls out of station. You are standing on the platform watching the train move from left to right. To you it looks as if the boy is moving from left to right because relative to where you are standing (the platform) he is moving. According to the boy and his frame of reference (the train) he is not moving. frame of reference must have an origin (where you are standing on the platform) and at least positive direction. The train was moving from left to right making to your right positive and to your left negative. If someone else was looking at the same boy his frame of reference will be different. For example if he was standing on the other side of the platform the boy will be moving from right to left. ,Definition: Frame of reference Frame of reference is reference point combined with set of Direction (geometry) Frame of reference is similar to the idea of reference point.

22,22,3.2.2,Position,25,Definition: Position Position is measurement of location with reference to an origin. position is measurement of location with reference to an origin. Positions can therefore be negative or positive. The symbol is used to indicate position. has units of length for example cm or km. Figure 3.2.2 shows the position of school. Depending on what reference point we choose we can say that the school is 300 from Joans house (with Joans house as the reference point or origin) or 500 from Joels house (with Joels house as the reference point or origin). The shop is also 300 from Joans house but in the opposite direction as the school. When we choose reference point we have positive direction and negative direction. If we choose the direction towards the school as positive then the direction towards the shop is negative. negative direction is always opposite to the direction chosen as positive. ,Definition: Position (vector) Position (vector) is measurement of location with reference to an origin.

23,23,3.3,Displacement and Distance,28,Definition: Displacement Displacement is the change in an objects position. The displacement of an object is defined as its change in position (final position minus initial position). Displacement has magnitude and direction and is therefore vector. For example if the initial position of car is xi and it moves to final position of xf then the displacement is: However subtracting an initial quantity from final quantity happens often in Physics so we use the shortcut to mean final initial. Therefore displacement can be written: Important: The words initial and final will be used very often in Physics. Initial will always refer to something that happened earlier in time and final will always refer to something that happened later in time. It will often happen that the final value is smaller than the initial value such that the difference is negative. This is ok Displacement does not depend on the path travelled but only on the initial and final positions (Figure 3.4). We use the word distance to describe how far an object travels along particular path. Distance is the actual distance that was covered. Distance (symbol d) does not have direction so it is scalar. Displacement is the shortest distance from the starting point to the endpoint from the school to the shop in the figure. Displacement has direction and is therefore vector. Figure 3.2.2 shows the five houses we discussed earlier. Jack walks to school but instead of walking straight to school he decided to walk to his friend Joels house first to fetch him so that they can walk to school together. Jack covers distance of 400 to Joels house and another 500 to school. He covers distance of 900 m. His displacement however is only 100 towards the school. This is because displacement only looks at the starting position (his house) and the end position (the school). It does not depend on the path he travelled. To calculate his distance and displacement we need to choose reference point and direction. Lets choose Jacks house as the reference point and towards Joels house as the positive direc- tion (which means that towards the school is negative). We would do the calculations as follows: It is possible to have displacement of and distance that is not m. This happens when an object completes round trip back to its original position like an athlete running around track. ,Definition: Displacement (vector) Displacement (vector) is the change in an objects Position (vector) The Displacement (vector) of an object is defined as its change in Position (vector) (final Position (vector) minus initial Position (vector) Displacement (vector) has magnitude and Direction (geometry) and is therefore Euclidean vector For example if the initial Position (vector) of car is xi and it moves to final Position (vector) of xf then the Displacement (vector) is: However subtracting an initial quantity from final quantity happens often in Physics so we use the shortcut to mean final initial.

24,24,3.3.1,Interpreting Direction,29,Very often in calculations you will get negative answer. For example Jacks displacement in the example above is calculated as -100 m. The minus sign in front of the answer means that his displacement is 100 in the opposite direction (opposite to the direction chosen as positive in the beginning of the question). When we start calculation we choose frame of reference and positive direction. In the first example above the reference point is Jacks house and the positive direction is towards Joels house. Therefore Jacks displacement is 100 towards the school. Notice that distance has no direction but displacement has. ,Very often in calculations you will get negative answer.

26,26,3.4,"Speed, Average Velocity and Instantaneous Velocity",31,Definition: Velocity Velocity is the rate of change of position. Definition: Instantaneous velocity Instantaneous velocity is the velocity of an accelerating body at specific instant in time. Definition: Average velocity Average velocity is the total displacement of body over time interval. Velocity is the rate of change of position. It tells us how much an objects position changes in time. This is the same as the displacement divided by the time taken. Since displacement is vector and time taken is scalar velocity is also vector. We use the symbol for velocity. If we have displacement of and time taken of is then defined as: Velocity can be positive or negative. Positive values of velocity mean that the object is moving away from the reference point or origin and negative values mean that the object is moving towards the reference point or origin. Important: An instant in time is different from the time taken or the time interval. It is therefore useful to use the symbol for an instant in time (for example during the 4th second) and the symbol for the time taken (for example during the first seconds of the motion). Average velocity (symbol v) is the displacement for the whole motion divided by the time taken for the whole motion. Instantaneous velocity is the velocity at specific instant in time. (Average) Speed (symbol s) is the distance travelled (d) divided by the time taken (t) for the journey. Distance and time are scalars and therefore speed will also be scalar. Speed is calculated as follows: Instantaneous speed is the magnitude of instantaneous velocity. It has the same value but no direction. ,Definition: Velocity Velocity is the rate of change of Position (vector) Definition: Instantaneous Velocity Instantaneous Velocity is the Velocity of an accelerating body at specific instant in time.

28,28,3.5,Acceleration,38,Definition: Acceleration Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. Acceleration (symbol a) is the rate of change of velocity. It is measure of how fast the velocity of an object changes in time. If we have change in velocity (v) over time interval (t) then the acceleration (a) is defined as: Since velocity is vector acceleration is also vector. Acceleration does not provide any infor- mation about motion but only about how the motion changes. It is not possible to tell how fast an object is moving or in which direction from the acceleration. Like velocity acceleration can be negative or positive. We see that when the sign of the acceler- ation and the velocity are the same the object is speeding up. If both velocity and acceleration are positive the object is speeding up in positive direction. If both velocity and acceleration are negative the object is speeding up in negative direction. If velocity is positive and accel- eration is negative then the object is slowing down. Similarly if the velocity is negative and the acceleration is positive the object is slowing down. This is illustrated in the following worked example. Important: Acceleration does not tell us about the direction of the motion. Acceleration only tells us how the velocity changes. Important: Deceleration Avoid the use of the word deceleration to refer to negative acceleration. This word usually means slowing down and it is possible for an object to slow down with both positive and negative acceleration because the sign of the velocity of the object must also be taken into account to determine whether the body is slowing down or not. ,Definition: Acceleration Acceleration is the rate of change of Velocity Acceleration (symbol a) is the rate of change of Velocity It is measure of how fast the Velocity of an object changes in time.

There are many ways of describing motion: 1. words 2. diagrams 3. graphs These methods will be described in this section. We will consider three types of motion: when the object is not moving (stationary object) when the object is moving at constant velocity (uniform motion) and when the object is moving at constant acceleration (motion at constant acceleration). ,The purpose of this chapter is to describe Motion and now that we understand the definitions of Displacement (vector) Distance Velocity Speed and acceleration we are ready to start using these ideas to describe how an object is moving.

30,30,3.6.1,Stationary Object,40,The simplest motion that we can come across is that of stationary object. stationary object does not move and so its position does not change for as long as it is standing still. An example of this situation is when someone is waiting for something without moving. The person remains in the same position. Lesedi is waiting for taxi. He is standing two metres from stop street at s. After one minute at 60 he is still metres from the stop street and after two minutes at 120 also metres from the stop street. His position has not changed. His displacement is zero (because his position is the same) his velocity is zero (because his displacement is zero) and his acceleration is also zero (because his velocity is not changing). We can now draw graphs of position vs.time (x vs. t) velocity vs.time (v vs. t) and acceleration vs.time (a vs. t) for stationary object. The graphs are shown in Figure 3.5. Lesedis position is metres from the stop street. If the stop street is taken as the reference point his position remains at metres for 120 seconds. The graph is horisontal line at m. The velocity and acceleration graphs are also shown. They are both horisontal lines on the x-axis. Since his position is not changing his velocity is ms1and since velocity is not changing acceleration is ms2. Definition: Gradient The gradient of line can be calculated by dividing the change in the y-value by the change in the x-value. Since we know that velocity is the rate of change of position we can confirm the value for the velocity vs. time graph by calculating the gradient of the vs. graph. ,The simplest Motion that we can come across is that of stationary object. stationary object does not move and so its Position (vector) does not change for as long as it is standing still. An example of this situation is when someone is waiting for something without moving. The person remains in the same Position (vector) Lesedi is waiting for taxi. He is standing two Metre from stop street at s. After one minute at 60 he is still Metre from the stop street and after two minutes at 120 also Metre from the stop street. His Position (vector) has not changed. His Displacement (vector) is zero (because his Position (vector) is the same) his Velocity is zero (because his Displacement (vector) is zero) and his acceleration is also zero (because his Velocity is not changing). We can now draw graphs of Position (vector) vs.time (x vs. t) Velocity vs.time (v vs. t) and acceleration vs.time (a vs. t) for stationary object. The graphs are shown in Figure 3.5. Lesedis Position (vector) is Metre from the stop street. If the stop street is taken as the reference point his Position (vector) remains at Metre for 120 seconds. The graph is horisontal line at m. The Velocity and acceleration graphs are also shown. They are both horisontal lines on the x-axis. Since his Position (vector) is not changing his Velocity is ms1and since Velocity is not changing acceleration is ms2.

31,31,3.6.2,Motion at Constant Velocity,41,Motion at constant velocity or uniform motion means that the position of the object is changing at the same rate. Assume that Lesedi takes 100 to walk the 100 to the taxi-stop every morning. If we assume that Lesedis house is the origin then Lesedis velocity is: Lesedis velocity is ms1. This means that he walked in the first second another metre in the second second and another in the third second and so on. For example after 50 he will be 50 from home. His position increases by every s. diagram of Lesedis position is shown in Figure 3.6. We can now draw graphs of position vs.time (x vs. t) velocity vs.time (v vs. t) and acceleration vs.time (a vs. t) for Lesedi moving at constant velocity. The graphs are shown in Figure 3.7. In the evening Lesedi walks 100 from the bus stop to his house in 100 s. Assume that Lesedis house is the origin. The following graphs can be drawn to describe the motion. We see that the vs. graph is horisontal line. If the velocity vs. time graph is horisontal line it means that the velocity is constant (not changing). Motion at constant velocity is known as uniform motion. We can use the vs. to calculate the velocity by finding the gradient of the line. Lesedi has velocity of -1 ms1 or ms1towards his house. You will notice that the vs. graph is horisontal line corresponding to velocity of -1 ms1. The horisontal line means that the velocity stays the same (remains constant) during the motion. This is uniform velocity. ,Motion at constant Velocity or uniform Motion means that the Position (vector) of the object is changing at the same rate. Assume that Lesedi takes 100 to walk the 100 to the taxi-stop every morning. If we assume that Lesedis house is the origin then Lesedis Velocity is: Lesedis Velocity is ms1. This means that he walked in the first second another Metre in the second second and another in the third second and so on. For example after 50 he will be 50 from home. His Position (vector) increases by every s. diagram of Lesedis Position (vector) is shown in Figure 3.6. We can now draw graphs of Position (vector) vs.time (x vs. t) Velocity vs.time (v vs. t) and acceleration vs.time (a vs. t) for Lesedi moving at constant Velocity The graphs are shown in Figure 3.7.

The horisontal line means that the <b>Velocity</b> stays the same (remains constant) during the <b>Motion</b> This is uniform <b>Velocity</b>
32,32,3.6.3,Motion at Constant Acceleration,46,The final situation we will be studying is motion at constant acceleration. We know that acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. So if we have constant acceleration this means that the velocity changes at constant rate. Lets look at our first example of Lesedi waiting at the taxi stop again. taxi arrived and Lesedi got in. The taxi stopped at the stop street and then accelerated as follows: After the taxi covered distance of 25 after it covered 10 after seconds it covered 225 and after it covered 40 m. The taxi is covering larger distance every second. This means that it is accelerating. The acceleration does not change during the motion (the gradient stays constant). This is motion at constant or uniform acceleration. The graphs for this situation are shown in Figure 3.9. Velocity from Acceleration vs. Time Graphs Just as we used velocity vs. time graphs to find displacement we can use acceleration vs. time graphs to find the velocity of an object at given moment in time. We simply calculate the area under the acceleration vs. time graph at given time. In the graph below showing an object at constant positive acceleration the increase in velocity of the object after seconds corresponds to the shaded portion. The velocity of the object at is therefore 10 ms1. This corresponds with the values obtained in Figure 3.9. Important: Often you will be required to describe the motion of an object that is presented as graph of either position velocity or acceleration as functions of time. The description of the motion represented by graph should include the following (where possible): 1. whether the object is moving in the positive or negative direction 2. whether the object is at rest moving at constant velocity or moving at constant positive acceleration (speeding up) or constant negative acceleration (slowing down) You will also often be required to draw graphs based on description of the motion in words or from diagram. Remember that these are just different methods of presenting the same information. If you keep in mind the general shapes of the graphs for the different types of motion there should not be any difficulty with explaining what is happening. ,The final situation we will be studying is Motion at constant acceleration.

42,42,4.2.2,Free fall,69,Important: Free fall is motion in the Earths gravitational field when no other forces act on the object. Free fall is the term used to describe special kind of motion in the Earths gravitational field. Free fall is motion in the Earths gravitational field when no other forces act on the object. It is basically an ideal situation since in reality there is always some air friction which slows down the motion. If metal ball and tennis ball (of the same size) were dropped from the same height both would reach the ground at the same time. It does not matter that the one ball is heavier than the other. The acceleration of an object due to gravity is independent of the mass of the object. It does not matter what the mass of the object is. The shape of the object however is important. The sheet of paper took much longer to reach the ground than the tennis ball. This is because the effect of air friction on the paper was much greater than the air friction on the tennis ball. If we lived in world where there was no air resistance the A4 sheet of paper and the tennis ball would reach the ground at the same time. This happens in outer space or in vaccuum. Galileo Galilei an Italian scientist studied the motion of objects. The following case study will tell you more about one of his investigations. ,Important: Free fall is Motion in the Earths Gravitational field when no other Force act on the object.

43,43,4.3,Potential Energy,73,The potential energy of an object is generally defined as the energy an object has because of its position relative to other objects that it interacts with. There are different kinds of potential energy such as gravitional potential energy chemical potential energy electrical potential energy to name few. In this section we will be looking at gravitational potential energy. Definition: Potential energy Potential energy is the energy an object has due to its position or state. Gravitational potential energy is the energy of an object due to its position above the surface of the Earth. The symbol PE is used to refer to gravitational potential energy. You will often find that the words potential energy are used where gravitational potential energy is meant. We can define potential energy (or gravitational potential energy if you like) as: PE mgh (4.5) where PE potential energy measured in joules (J) mass of the object (measured in kg) gravitational acceleration (98 ms2) perpendicular height from the reference point (measured in m) suitcase with mass of kg is placed at the top of high cupboard. By lifting the suitcase against the force of gravity we give the suitcase potential energy. This potential energy can be calculated using equation 4.5. If the suitcase falls off the cupboard it will lose its potential energy. Halfway down the cupboard the suitcase will have lost half its potential energy and will have only 98 left. At the bottom of the cupboard the suitcase will have lost all its potential energy and its potential energy will be equal to zero.

44,44,4.4,Kinetic Energy,75,Definition: Kinetic Energy Kinetic energy is the energy an object has due to its motion. Kinetic energy is the energy an object has because of its motion. This means that any moving object has kinetic energy. The faster it moves the more kinetic energy it has. Kinetic energy (KE) is therefore dependent on the velocity of the object. The mass of the object also plays role. truck of 2000 kg moving at 100 kmhr1 will have more kinetic energy than car of 500 kg also moving at 100 kmhr1. Kinetic energy is defined as: Consider the kg suitcase on the cupboard that was discussed earlier. When the suitcase falls it will gain velocity (fall faster) until it reaches the ground with maximum velocity. The suitcase will not have any kinetic energy when it is on top of the cupboard because it is not moving. Once it starts to fall it will gain kinetic energy because it gains velocity. Its kinetic energy will increase until it is maximum when the suitcase reaches the ground. ,Definition: Kinetic Energy Kinetic Energy is the Energy an object has due to its Motion Kinetic Energy is the Energy an object has because of its Motion This means that any moving object has kinetic Energy The faster it moves the more kinetic Energy it has.

Definition: Conservation of Energy The Law of Conservation of Energy: Energy cannot be created or destroyed but is merely changed from one form into another. So far we have looked at two types of energy: gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy. The sum of the gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy is called the mechanical energy. In closed system one where there are no external forces acting the mechanical energy will remain constant. In other words it will not change (become more or less). This is called the Law of Conservation of Mechanical Energy and it states: The total amount of mechanical energy in closed system remains constant. Definition: Conservation of Mechanical Energy Law of Conservation of Mechanical Energy: The total amount of mechanical energy in closed system remains constant. This means that potential energy can become kinetic energy or vise versa but energy cannot dissappear. The mechanical energy of an object moving in the Earths gravitational field (or accelerating as result of gravity) is constant or conserved unless external forces like air resistance acts on the object. We can now use the conservation of mechanical energy to calculate the velocity of body in freefall and show that the velocity is independent of mass. Important: In problems involving the use of conservation of energy the path taken by the object can be ignored. The only important quantities are the objects velocity (which gives its kinetic energy) and height above the reference point (which gives its gravitational potential energy). Important: In the absence of friction mechanical energy is conserved and Ubefore Uafter In the presence of friction mechanical energy is not conserved. The mechanical energy lost is equal to the work done against friction. Ubefore Uafter work done against friction In general mechanical energy is conserved in the absence of external forces. Examples of external forces are: applied forces frictional forces air resistance tension normal forces.

48,48,4.5.2,Using the Law of Conservation of Energy,79,Mechanical energy is conserved (in the absence of friction). Therefore we can say that the sum of the PE and the KE anywhere during the motion must be equal to the sum of the PE and the KE anywhere else in the motion. We can now apply this to the example of the suitcase on the cupboard. Consider the mechanical energy of the suitcase at the top and at the bottom. We can say: The suitcase will strike the ground with velocity of 626 ms1. From this we see that when an object is lifted like the suitcase in our example it gains potential energy. As it falls back to the ground it will lose this potential energy but gain kinetic en- ergy. We know that energy cannot be created or destroyed but only changed from one form into another. In our example the potential energy that the suitcase loses is changed to kinetic energy. The suitcase will have maximum potential energy at the top of the cupboard and maximum kinetic energy at the bottom of the cupboard. Halfway down it will have half kinetic energy and half potential energy. As it moves down the potential energy will be converted (changed) into kinetic energy until all the potential energy is gone and only kinetic energy is left. The 196 of potential energy at the top will become 196 of kinetic energy at the bottom. ,Mechanical energy is conserved (in the absence of Friction Therefore we can say that the sum of the PE and the Kinetic energy anywhere during the Motion must be equal to the sum of the PE and the Kinetic energy anywhere else in the Motion We can now apply this to the example of the suitcase on the cupboard.

We will look at how each quantity changes as the suitcase falls from the top to the bottom of the cupboard. Potential energy: The potential energy starts off at maximum and decreases until it reaches zero at the bottom of the cupboard. It had fallen distance of metres. Kinetic energy: The kinetic energy is zero at the start of the fall. When the suitcase reaches the ground the kinetic energy is miximum. We also use distance on the x-axis. Mechanical energy: The mechanical energy is constant throughout the motion and is always maximum. At any point in time when we add the potential energy and the kinetic energy we will get the same number. ,Let us consider our example of the suitcase on the cupboard once more.

52,52,5.2,What is a medium?,87,In this chapter as well as in the following chapters we will speak about waves moving in medium. medium is just the substance or material through which waves move. In other words the medium carries the wave from one place to another. The medium does not create the wave and the medium is not the wave. Air is medium for sound waves water is medium for water waves and rock is medium for earthquakes (which are also type of wave). Air water and rock are therefore examples of media (media is the plural of medium). Definition: Medium medium is the substance or material in which wave will move. In each medium the atoms that make up the medium are moved temporarily from their rest position. In order for wave to travel the different parts of the medium must be able to interact with each other. ,In this chapter as well as in the following chapters we will speak about Wave moving in medium. medium is just the substance or material through which Wave move.

53,53,5.3,What is a pulse?,87,In the activity we created pulse. pulse is single disturbance that moves through medium. transverse pulse moves perpendicular to the medium. Figure 5.1 shows an example of transverse pulse. In the activity the rope or spring was held horizontally and the pulse moved the rope up and down. This was an example of transverse pulse.

Definition: Pulse pulse is single disturbance that moves through medium.
54,54,5.3.1,Pulse Length and Amplitude,88,The amplitude of pulse is measurement of how far the medium is displaced from position of rest. The pulse length is measurement of how long the pulse is. Both these quantities are shown in Figure 5.1. Definition: Amplitude The amplitude of pulse is measurement of how far the medium is displaced from rest. In the activity we found that the values for how high the pulse (a) is and how wide the pulse (p) is the same at different times. Pulse length and amplitude are two important quantities of pulse. ,The Amplitude of pulse is measurement of how far the medium is Displacement (vector) from Position (vector) of rest.

55,55,5.3.2,Pulse Speed,89,Definition: Pulse Speed Pulse speed is the distance pulse travels in specific time. In Chapter we saw that speed was defined as the distance travelled in specified time.

59,59,5.5,Transmission and Reflection of a Pulse at a Boundary,96,What happens when pulse travelling in one medium finds that medium is joined to another? When pulse meets boundary between two media part of the pulse is reflected and part of it is transmitted. You will see that in the thin rope the pulse moves back (is reflected). The pulse is also passed on (transmitted) to the thick rope and it moves away from the boundary. When pulse is transmitted from one medium to another like from thin rope to thicker one the pulse will change where it meets the boundary of the two mediums (for example where the ropes are joined). When pulse moves from thin rope to thicker one the speed of the pulse will decrease. The pulse will move slower and the pulse length will increase. When pulse moves from thick rope to thinner one the opposite happens. The pulse speed will increase and the pulse length will decrease. When the speed of the pulse increases the pulse length will decrease. If the speed decreases the pulse length will increase. The incident pulse is the one that arrives at the boundary. The reflected pulse is the one that moves back away from the boundary. The transmitted pulse is the one that moves into the new medium away from the boundary. ,What happens when pulse travelling in one medium finds that medium is joined to another?

63,63,5.7,Superposition of Pulses,99,Two or more pulses can pass through the same medium at that same time. The resulting pulse is obtained by using the principle of superposition. The principle of superposition states that the effect of the pulses is the sum of their individual effects. After pulses pass through each other each pulse continues along its original direction of travel and their original amplitudes remain unchanged. Constructive interference takes place when two pulses meet each other to create larger pulse. The amplitude of the resulting pulse is the sum of the amplitudes of the two initial pulses. This is shown in Figure 5.11. Definition: Constructive interference is when two pulses meet resulting in bigger pulse. Destructive interference takes place when two pulses meet and cancel each other. The amplitude of the resulting pulse is the sum of the amplitudes of the two initial pulses but the one amplitude will be negative number. This is shown in Figure 5.12.

66,66,6.2,What is a transverse wave?,105,We have studied pulses in Chapter and know that pulse is single disturbance that travels through medium. wave is periodic continuous disturbance that consists of train of pulses. Definition: Wave wave is periodic continuous disturbance that consists of train of pulses. Definition: Transverse wave transverse wave is wave where the movement of the particles of the medium is perpen- dicular to the direction of propagation of the wave. In the Activity you have created waves. The medium through which these waves propagated was the rope which is obviously made up of very large number of particles (atoms). From the activity you would have noticed that the wave travelled from left to right but the particles (the ribbon) moved only up and down. When the particles of medium move at right angles to the direction of propagation of wave the wave is called transverse. For waves there is no net displacement of the particles (they return to their equilibrium position) but there is net displacement of the wave. There are thus two different motions: the motion of the particles of the medium and the motion of the wave. ,We have studied pulses in Chapter and know that pulse is single disturbance that travels through medium.

67,67,6.2.1,Peaks and Troughs,106,Waves consist of moving peaks (or crests) and troughs. peak is the highest point the medium rises to and trough is the lowest point the medium sinks to. Peaks and troughs on transverse wave are shown in Figure 6.2. Definition: Peaks and troughs peak is point on the wave where the displacement of the medium is at maximum. point on the wave is trough if the displacement of the medium at that point is at minimum. ,Wave consist of moving peaks (or Crest (physics) and Crest (physics) peak is the highest point the medium rises to and Crest (physics) is the lowest point the medium sinks to.

68,68,6.2.2,Amplitude and Wavelength,107,There are few properties that we saw with pulses that also apply to waves. These are amplitude and wavelength (we called this pulse length). Definition: Amplitude The amplitude is the maximum displacement of particle from its equilibrium position. As we have seen in the activity on amplitude the distance between the peak and the equilibrium position is equal to the distance between the trough and the equilibrium position. This distance is known as the amplitude of the wave and is the characteristic height of wave above or below the equilibrium position. Normally the symbol is used to represent the amplitude of wave. The SI unit of amplitude is the metre (m). As we have seen in the activity on wavelength the distance between two adjacent peaks is the same no matter which two adjacent peaks you choose. There is fixed distance between the peaks. Similarly we have seen that there is fixed distance between the troughs no matter which two troughs you look at. More importantly the distance between two adjacent peaks is the same as the distance between two adjacent troughs. This distance is call the wavelength of the wave. The symbol for the wavelength is (the Greek letter lambda) and wavelength is measured in metres (m). ,There are few properties that we saw with pulses that also apply to Wave These are Amplitude and Wavelength (we called this pulse Length Definition: Amplitude The Amplitude is the maximum Displacement (vector) of particle from its equilibrium Position (vector) As we have seen in the activity on Amplitude the Distance between the peak and the equilibrium Position (vector) is equal to the Distance between the Crest (physics) and the equilibrium Position (vector) This Distance is known as the Amplitude of the Wave and is the characteristic height of Wave above or below the equilibrium Position (vector) Normally the symbol is used to represent the Amplitude of Wave The SI unit of Amplitude is the Metre (m).

69,69,6.2.3,Points in Phase,109,In the activity the distance between the indicated points was the same. These points are then said to be in phase. Two points in phase are separate by an integer (0123...) number of complete wave cycles. They do not have to be peaks or troughs but they must be separated by complete number of wavelengths. We then have an alternate definition of the wavelength as the distance between any two adjacent points which are in phase. Definition: Wavelength of wave The wavelength of wave is the distance between any two adjacent points that are in phase. Points that are not in phase those that are not separated by complete number of wavelengths are called out of phase. Examples of points like these would be and or and or and in the Activity. ,In the activity the Distance between the indicated points was the same. These points are then said to be in phase.

70,70,6.2.4,Period and Frequency,110,Imagine you are sitting next to pond and you watch the waves going past you. First one peak arrives then trough and then another peak. Suppose you measure the time taken between one peak arriving and then the next. This time will be the same for any two successive peaks passing you. We call this time the period and it is characteristic of the wave. The symbol is used to represent the period. The period is measured in seconds (s). Definition: The period (T) is the time taken for two successive peaks (or troughs) to pass fixed point. Imagine the pond again. Just as peak passes you you start your stopwatch and count each peak going past. After second you stop the clock and stop counting. The number of peaks that you have counted in the second is the frequency of the wave. Definition: The frequency is the number of successive peaks (or troughs) passing given point in second. The frequency and the period are related to each other. As the period is the time taken for peak to pass then the number of peaks passing the point in second is But this is the frequency.

72,72,6.3,Graphs of Particle Motion,115,In Chapter we saw that when pulse moves through medium there are two different motions: the motion of the particles of the medium and the motion of the pulse. These two motions are at right angles to each other when the pulse is transverse. Since transverse wave is series of transverse pulses the particle in the medium and the wave move in exactly the same way as for the pulse. When transverse wave moves through the medium the particles in the medium only move up and down. We can see this in the figure below which shows the motion of single particle as transverse wave moves through the medium. As in Chapter we can draw graph of the particles position as function of time. For the wave shown in the above figure we can draw the graph shown below. The graph of the particles velocity as function of time is obtained by taking the gradient of the position vs. time graph. The graph of velocity vs. time for the position vs. time graph above is shown in the graph below. The graph of the particles acceleration as function of time is obtained by taking the gradient of the velocity vs. time graph. The graph of acceleration vs. time for the position vs. time graph shown above is shown below. As for motion in one dimension these graphs can be used to describe the motion of the particle.

As in Chapter we can draw graph of the particles <b>Position (vector)</b> as function of time. For the <b>Wave</b> shown in the above figure we can draw the graph shown below. The graph of the particles <b>Velocity</b> as function of time is obtained by taking the gradient of the <b>Motion graphs and derivatives</b> The graph of <b>Velocity</b> vs. time for the <b>Motion graphs and derivatives</b> above is shown in the graph below. The graph of the particles acceleration as function of time is obtained by taking the gradient of the <b>Velocity</b> vs. time graph. The graph of acceleration vs. time for the <b>Motion graphs and derivatives</b> shown above is shown below. As for <b>Motion</b> in one dimension these graphs can be used to describe the <b>Motion</b> of the particle. This is illustrated in the <b>Work (physics)</b> examples below.

76,76,6.4.3,Standing Waves,118,What happens when reflected transverse wave meets an incident transverse wave? When two waves move in opposite directions through each other interference takes place. If the two waves have the same frequency and wavelength then standing waves are generated. Standing waves are so-called because they appear to be standing still. We can now look closely how standing waves are formed. Figure 6.5 shows reflected wave meeting an incident wave. When they touch both waves have an amplitude of zero: Figure 6.6: reflected wave (solid line) meets the incident wave (dashed line). If we wait for short time the ends of the two waves move past each other and the waves overlap. To find the resultant wave we add the two together. Figure 6.7: reflected wave (solid line) overlaps slightly with the incident wave (dashed line). In this picture we show the two waves as dotted lines and the sum of the two in the overlap region is shown as solid line: The important thing to note in this case is that there are some points where the two waves always destructively interfere to zero. If we let the two waves move little further we get the picture below: Again we have to add the two waves together in the overlap region to see what the sum of the waves looks like. In this case the two waves have moved half cycle past each other but because they are out of phase they cancel out completely. When the waves have moved past each other so that they are overlapping for large region the situation looks like wave oscillating in place. The following sequence of diagrams show what the resulting wave will look like. To make it clearer the arrows at the top of the picture show peaks where maximum positive constructive interference is taking place. The arrows at the bottom of the picture show places where maximum negative interference is taking place. As time goes by the peaks become smaller and the troughs become shallower but they do not move. For an instant the entire region will look completely flat. The various points continue their motion in the same manner. Eventually the picture looks like the complete reflection through the x-axis of what we started with: Then all the points begin to move back. Each point on the line is oscillating up and down with different amplitude. If we look at the overall result we get standing wave. Figure 6.8: standing wave If we superimpose the two cases where the peaks were at maximum and the case where the same waves were at minimum we can see the lines that the points oscillate between. We call this the envelope of the standing wave as it contains all the oscillations of the individual points. To make the concept of the envelope clearer let us draw arrows describing the motion of points along the line. Every point in the medium containing standing wave oscillates up and down and the amplitude of the oscillations depends on the location of the point. It is convenient to draw the envelope for the oscillations to describe the motion. We cannot draw the up and down arrows for every single point Interesting Fact Standing waves can be problem in for example indoor concerts where the dimensions of the concert venue coincide with particular wavelengths. Standing waves can appear as feedback which would occur if the standing wave was picked up by the microphones on stage and amplified. ,What happens when Reflection (physics) transverse Wave meets an incident transverse Wave When two Wave move in opposite Direction (geometry) through each other interference takes place.

It is the same as the distance between two adjacent nodes. This will be important when we work out the allowed wavelengths in tubes later.

78,78,6.4.5,Wavelengths of Standing Waves with Fixed and Free Ends,122,There are many applications which make use of the properties of waves and the use of fixed and free ends. Most musical instruments rely on the basic picture that we have presented to create specific sounds either through standing pressure waves or standing vibratory waves in strings. The key is to understand that standing wave must be created in the medium that is oscillating. There are restrictions as to what wavelengths can form standing waves in medium. For example if we consider rope that can move in pipe such that it can have both ends free to move (Case 1) one end free and one end fixed (Case 2) both ends fixed (Case 3). Each of these cases is slightly different because the free or fixed end determines whether node or anti-node will form when standing wave is created in the rope. These are the main restrictions when we determine the wavelengths of potential standing waves. These restrictions are known as boundary conditions and must be met. In the diagram below you can see the three different cases. It is possible to create standing waves with different frequencies and wavelengths as long as the end criteria are met. The longer the wavelength the less the number of anti-nodes in the standing waves. We cannot have standing wave with no anti-nodes because then there would be no oscillations. We use to number the anti-nodes. If all of the tubes have length and we know the end constraints we can find the wavelength for specific number of anti-nodes. One Node Lets work out the longest wavelength we can have in each tube i.e. the case for Case 1: In the first tube both ends must be nodes so we can place one anti-node in the middle of the tube. We know the distance from one node to another is and we also know this distance is L. So we can equate the two and solve for the wavelength: Case 2: In the second tube one end must be node and the other must be an anti-node. We are looking at the case with one anti-node we are forced to have it at the end. We know the distance from one node to another is but we only have half this distance contained in the tube. So Case 3: Here both ends are closed and so we must have two nodes so it is impossible to construct case with only one node. Two Nodes Next we determine which wavelengths could be formed if we had two nodes. Remember that we are dividing the tube up into smaller and smaller segments by having more nodes so we expect the wavelengths to get shorter. 3L 2L Case 1: Both ends are open and so they must be anti-nodes. We can have two nodes inside the tube only if we have one anti-node contained inside the tube and one on each end. This means we have anti-nodes in the tube. The distance between any two anti-nodes is half wavelength. This means there is half wavelength between the left side and the middle and another half wavelength between the middle and the right side so there must be one wavelength inside the tube. The safest thing to do is work out how many half wavelengths there are and equate this to the length of the tube and then solve for Case 2: We want to have two nodes inside the tube. The left end must be node and the right end must be an anti-node. We can have one node inside the tube as drawn above. Again we can count the number of distances between adjacent nodes or anti-nodes. If we start from the left end we have one half wavelength between the end and the node inside the tube. The distance from the node inside the tube to the right end which is an anti-node is half of the distance to another node. So it is half of half wavelength. Together these add up to the length of the tube: Case 3: In this case both ends have to be nodes. This means that the length of the tube is one half wavelength: So we can equate the two and solve for the wavelength: 2L Important: If you ever calculate longer wavelength for more nodes you have made mistake. Remember to check if your answers make sense Three Nodes To see the complete pattern for all cases we need to check what the next step for case is when we have an additional node. Below is the diagram for the case where 3. 3L 5L Case 1: Both ends are open and so they must be anti-nodes. We can have three nodes inside the tube only if we have two anti-nodes contained inside the tube and one on each end. This means we have anti-nodes in the tube. The distance between any two anti-nodes is half wavelength. This means there is half wavelength between every adjacent pair of anti-nodes. We count how many gaps there are between adjacent anti-nodes to determine how many half wavelengths there are and equate this to the length of the tube and then solve for we can count the number of distances between adjacent nodes or anti-nodes together these add up to the length of the tube. Remember that the distance between the node and an adjacent anti-node is only half the distance between adjacent nodes. So starting from the left end we count nodes so half wavelength intervals and then only node to anti-node distance: 2( Case 3: In this case both ends have to be nodes. With one node in between there are two sets of adjacent nodes. This means that the length of the tube consists of two half wavelength sections: ,There are many applications which make use of the properties of Wave and the use of fixed and free ends.

79,79,6.4.6,Superposition and Interference,125,If two waves meet interesting things can happen. Waves are basically collective motion of particles. So when two waves meet they both try to impose their collective motion on the particles. This can have quite different results. If two identical (same wavelength amplitude and frequency) waves are both trying to form peak then they are able to achieve the sum of their efforts. The resulting motion will be peak which has height which is the sum of the heights of the two waves. If two waves are both trying to form trough in the same place then deeper trough is formed the depth of which is the sum of the depths of the two waves. Now in this case the two waves have been trying to do the same thing and so add together constructively. This is called constructive interference. If one wave is trying to form peak and the other is trying to form trough then they are competing to do different things. In this case they can cancel out. The amplitude of the resulting wave will depend on the amplitudes of the two waves that are interfering. If the depth of the trough is the same as the height of the peak nothing will happen. If the height of the peak is bigger than the depth of the trough smaller peak will appear. And if the trough is deeper then less deep trough will appear. This is destructive interference. ,If two Wave meet interesting things can happen. Wave are basically collective Motion of particles.

This is called constructive interference. If one Wave is trying to form peak and the other is trying to form Crest (physics) then they are competing to do different things. In this case they can cancel out. The Amplitude of the resulting Wave will depend on the Amplitude of the two Wave that are Interference (wave propagation) If the depth of the Crest (physics) is the same as the height of the peak nothing will happen. If the height of the peak is bigger than the depth of the Crest (physics) smaller peak will appear. And if the Crest (physics) is deeper then less deep Crest (physics) will appear. This is destructive interference. ,If two <b>Wave</b> meet interesting things can happen. <b>Wave</b> are basically collective <b>Motion</b> of particles.

81,81,7.1,Introduction,129,You are indoors on sunny day. beam of sunlight through window lights up section of the floor. How would you draw this sunbeam? You might draw series of parallel lines showing the path of the sunlight from the window to the floor. This is not exactly accurate no matter how hard you look you will not find unique lines of light in the sunbeam However this is good way to draw light. It is also good way to model light geometrically as we will see in this chapter. We will call these narrow imaginary lines of light light rays. Since light is an electromagnetic wave you could think of light ray as the path of point on the crest of wave. Or you could think of light ray as the path taken by miniscule particle that carries light. We will always draw them the same way: as straight lines between objects images and optical devices. We can use light rays to model mirrors lenses telescopes microscopes and prisms. The study of how light interacts with materials is optics. When dealing with light rays we are usually interested in the shape of material and the angles at which light rays hit it. From these angles we can work out for example the distance between an object and its reflection. We therefore refer to this kind of optics as geometrical optics. ,You are indoors on sunny day. beam of sunlight through window Light up section of the floor. How would you draw this sunbeam?

The most important thing to remember is that we can only see an object when light from the object enters our eyes.

86,86,7.3.1,Terminology,133,In Chapters and we saw that when pulse or wave strikes surface it is reflected. This means that waves bounce off things. Sound waves bounce off walls light waves bounce off mirrors radar waves bounce off aeroplanes and it can explain how bats can fly at night and avoid things as thin as telephone wires. The phenomenon of reflection is very important and useful one. We will use the following terminology. The incoming light ray is called the incident ray. The light ray moving away from the surface is the reflected ray. The most important characteristic of these rays is their angles in relation to the reflecting surface. These angles are measured with respect to the normal of the surface. The normal is an imaginary line perpendicular to the surface. The angle of incidence is measured between the incident ray and the surface normal. The angle of reflection is measured between the reflected ray and the surface normal. This is shown in Figure 7.4. When ray of light is reflected the reflected ray lies in the same plane as the incident ray and the normal. This plane is called the plane of incidence and is shown in Figure 7.5. ,In Chapters and we saw that when pulse or Wave strikes surface it is Reflection (physics) This means that Wave bounce off things.

87,87,7.3.2,Law of Reflection,133,The Law of Reflection states that the angles of incidence and reflection are always equal and that the reflected ray always lies in the plane of incidence. Definition: Law of Reflection The Law of Reflection states that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. The simplest example of the law of incidence is if the angle of incidence is 0. In this case the angle of reflection is also 0. You see this when you look straight into mirror. Figure 7.6: When wave strikes surface at right angles to the surface then the wave is reflected directly back. If the angle of incidence is not then the angle of reflection is also not 0. For example if light strikes surface at 60 to the surface normal then the angle that the reflected ray makes with the surface normal is also 60 as shown in Figure 7.7. Figure 7.7: Ray diagram showing angle of incidence and angle of reflection. The Law of Reflection states that when light ray reflects off surface the angle of reflection is the same as the angle of incidence i. ,Specular reflection states that the Angle of incidence and Reflection (physics) are always equal and that the Reflection (physics) Ray (optics) always lies in the plane of incidence.

88,88,7.3.3,Types of Reflection,135,The Law of Reflection is true for any surface. Does this mean that when parallel rays approach surface the reflected rays will also be parallel? This depends on the texture of the reflecting surface. Specular Reflection Figure 7.8(a) shows surface that is flat and even. Parallel incident light rays hit the smooth surface and parallel reflected light rays leave the surface. This type of reflection is called specular reflection. Specular reflection occurs when rays are reflected from smooth shiny surface. The normal to the surface is the same at every point on the surface. Parallel incident rays become parallel reflected rays. When you look in mirror the image you see is formed by specular reflection. Diffuse Reflection Figure 7.8(b) shows surface with bumps and curves. When multiple rays hit this uneven surface diffuse reflection occurs. The incident rays are parallel but the reflected rays are not. Each point on the surface has different normal. This means the angle of incidence is different at each point. Then according to the Law of Reflection each angle of reflection is different. Diffuse reflection occurs when light rays are reflected from bumpy surfaces. You can still see reflection as long as the surface is not too bumpy. Diffuse reflection enables us to see all objects that are not sources of light. ,Specular reflection is true for any surface.

89,89,7.4,Refraction,137,In the previous sections we studied light reflecting off various surfaces. What happens when light passes through medium? Like all waves the speed of light is dependent on the medium in which it is travelling. When light moves from one medium into another (for example from air to glass) the speed of light changes. The effect is that the light ray passing into new medium is refracted or bent. Refraction is therefore the bending of light as it moves from one optical medium to another. Definition: Refraction Refraction is the bending of light that occurs because light travels at different speeds in different materials. When light travels from one medium to another it will be bent away from its original path. When it travels from an optically dense medium like water or glass to less dense medium like air it will be refracted away from the normal (Figure 7.9). Whereas if it travels from less dense medium to denser one it will be refracted towards the normal (Figure 7.10). Just as we defined an angle of reflection in the previous section we can similarly define an angle of refraction as the angle between the surface normal and the refracted ray. This is shown in Figure 7.11. Figure 7.9: Light is moving from an optically dense medium to an optically less dense medium. Light is refracted away from the normal. Figure 7.10: Light is moving from an optically less dense medium to an optically denser medium. Light is refracted towards the normal.

So does light The speed of light and therefore the degree of bending of the light depends on the refractive index of material through which the light passes.

You can think of the refractive index as measure of how difficult it is for light to get through material.

If the refractive index increases the speed of light in the material must decrease. Light therefore travels slowly through materials of high n.

Definition: <b>Refraction</b> Index The <b>Refraction</b> index (symbol n) of material is the ratio of the <b>Speed</b> of <b>Light</b> in vacuum to its <b>Speed</b> in the material and gives an indication of how difficult it is for <b>Light</b> to get through the material. where <b>Refraction</b> index (no unit) <b>Speed</b> of <b>Light</b> in vacuum (300 108m s1) <b>Speed</b> of <b>Light</b> in given medium (m s1) Extension: <b>Refraction</b> Index and <b>Speed</b> of <b>Light</b> Using we can also examine how the <b>Speed</b> of <b>Light</b> changes in different media because the <b>Speed</b> of <b>Light</b> in vacuum (c) is constant. If the <b>Refraction</b> index increases the <b>Speed</b> of <b>Light</b> in the material must decrease. <b>Light</b> therefore travels slowly through materials of high n. Table 7.4.1 shows <b>Refraction</b> indices for various materials. <b>Light</b> travels slower in any material than it does in vacuum so all values for are greater than 1.
91,91,7.4.2,Snell's Law,139,Now that we know that the degree of bending or the angle of refraction is dependent on the refractive index of medium how do we calculate the angle of refraction? The angles of incidence and refraction when light travels from one medium to another can be calculated using Snells Law. Table 7.1: Refractive indices of some materials. nair is calculated at STP and all values are determined for yellow sodium light which has wavelength of 5893 nm. Definition: Snells Law n1 sin n2 sin where n1 Refractive index of material n2 Refractive index of material Angle of incidence Angle of refraction Remember that angles of incidence and refraction are measured from the normal which is an imaginary line perpendicular to the surface. Suppose we have two media with refractive indices n1 and n2. light ray is incident on the surface between these materials with an angle of incidence 1. The refracted ray that passes through the second medium will have an angle of refraction 2. If n2 n1 then from Snells Law sin sin 2. For angles smaller than 90 sin increases as increases. Therefore 2. This means that the angle of incidence is greater than the angle of refraction and the light ray is bent toward the normal. Similarly if n2 n1 then from Snells Law sin sin 2. For angles smaller than 90 sin increases as increases. Therefore 2. This means that the angle of incidence is less than the angle of refraction and the light ray is away toward the normal. Both these situations can be seen in Figure 7.12. Figure 7.12: Refraction of two light rays. (a) ray travels from medium of low refractive index to one of high refractive index. The ray is bent towards the normal. (b) ray travels from medium with high refractive index to one with low refractive index. The ray is bent away from the normal. What happens to ray that lies along the normal line? In this case the angle of incidence is and sin n1 n2 sin 0. This shows that if the light ray is incident at then the angle of refraction is also 0. The ray passes through the surface unchanged i.e. no refraction occurs. ,Now that we know that the degree of bending or the angle of Refraction is dependent on the Refraction index of medium how do we calculate the angle of Refraction The Angle of incidence and Refraction when Light travels from one medium to another can be calculated using Snell's law Table 7.1: Refraction indices of some materials. nair is calculated at STP and all values are determined for yellow sodium Light which has Wavelength of 5893 nm.

94,94,7.5.1,Image Formation,146,Definition: Image An image is representation of an object formed by mirror or lens. Light from the image is seen. If you place candle in front of mirror you now see two candles. The actual physical candle is called the object and the picture you see in the mirror is called the image. The object is the source of the incident rays. The image is the picture that is formed by the reflected rays. The object could be an actual source that emits light such as light bulb or candle. More commonly the object reflects light from another source. When you look at your face in the mirror your face does not emit light. Instead light from light bulb or from the sun reflects off your face and then hits the mirror. However in working with light rays it is easiest to pretend the light is coming from the object. An image formed by reflection may be real or virtual. real image occurs when light rays actually intersect at the image. real image is inverted or upside down. virtual image occurs when light rays do not actually meet at the image. Instead you see the image because your eye projects light rays backward. You are fooled into seeing an image virtual image is erect or right side up (upright). You can tell the two types apart by putting screen at the location of the image. real image can be formed on the screen because the light rays actually meet there. virtual image cannot be seen on screen since it is not really there. To describe objects and images we need to know their locations and their sizes. The distance from the mirror to the object is the object distance do.

The image is the same size as the object. 5. The image is upright. Virtual images are images formed in places where light does not really reach. Light does not really pass through the mirror to create the image it only appears to an observer as though the light were coming from behind the mirror.

96,96,7.5.3,Ray Diagrams,148,We draw ray diagrams to predict the image that is formed by plane mirror. ray diagram is geometrical picture that is used for analyzing the images formed by mirrors and lenses. We draw few characteristic rays from the object to the mirror. We then follow ray-tracing rules to find the path of the rays and locate the image. Important: mirror obeys the Law of Reflection. The ray diagram for the image formed by plane mirror is the simplest possible ray diagram. Figure 7.15 shows an object placed in front of plane mirror. It is convenient to have central line that runs perpendicular to the mirror. This imaginary line is called the principal axis. Important: Ray diagrams The following should be remembered when drawing ray diagrams: 1. Objects are represented by arrows. The length of the arrow represents the height of the object. 2. If the arrow points upwards then the object is described as upright or erect. If the arrow points downwards then the object is described as inverted. 3. If the object is real then the arrow is drawn with solid line. If the object is virtual then the arrow is drawn with dashed line. Method: Ray Diagrams for Plane Mirrors Ray diagrams are used to find the position and size and whether the image is real or virtual. 1. Draw the plane mirror as straight line on principal axis. 2. Draw the object as an arrow in front of the mirror. 3. Draw the image of the object by using the principle that the image is placed at the same distance behind the mirror that the object is in front of the mirror. The image size is also the same as the object size. 4. Place dot at the point the eye is located. 5. Pick one point on the image and draw the reflected ray that travels to the eye as it sees this point. Remember to add an arrowhead. 6. Draw the incident ray for light traveling from the corresponding point on the object to the mirror such that the law of reflection is obeyed. 7. Continue for other extreme points on the object. Suppose light ray leaves the top of the object traveling parallel to the principal axis. The ray will hit the mirror at an angle of incidence of degrees. We say that the ray hits the mirror normally. According to the law of reflection the ray will be reflected at degrees. The ray then bounces back in the same direction. We also project the ray back behind the mirror because this is what your eye does. Another light ray leaves the top of the object and hits the mirror at its centre. This ray will be reflected at the same angle as its angle of incidence as shown. If we project the ray backward behind the mirror it will eventually cross the projection of the first ray we drew. We have found the location of the image It is virtual image since it appears in an area that light cannot actually reach (behind the mirror). You can see from the diagram that the image is erect and is the same size as the object. This is exactly as we expected.

97,97,7.5.4,Spherical Mirrors,150,The second class of mirrors that we will look at are spherical mirrors. These mirrors are called spherical mirrors because if you take sphere and cut it as shown in Figure 7.16 and then polish the inside of one and the outside of the other you will get concave mirror and convex mirror as shown. These two mirrors will be studied in detail. The centre of curvature is the point at the centre of the sphere and describes how big the sphere is. ,The second class of mirrors that we will look at are Curved mirror These mirrors are called Curved mirror because if you take sphere and cut it as shown in Figure 7.16 and then polish the inside of one and the outside of the other you will get Curved mirror and Curved mirror as shown.

98,98,7.5.5,Concave Mirrors,150,The first type of curved mirror we will study are concave mirrors. Concave mirrors have the shape shown in Figure 7.17. As with plane mirror the principal axis is line that is perpendicular to the centre of the mirror. If you think of light reflecting off concave mirror you will immediately see that things will look very different compared to plane mirror. The easiest way to understand what will happen is to draw ray diagram and work out where the images will form. Once we have done that it is easy to see what properties the image has. First we need to define very important characteristic of the mirror. We have seen that the centre of curvature is the centre of the sphere from which the mirror is cut. We then define that distance that is half-way between the centre of curvature and the mirror on the principal axis. This point is known as the focal point and the distance from the focal point to the mirror is known as the focal length (symbol f). Since the focal point is the midpoint of the line segment joining the vertex and the center of curvature the focal length would be one-half the radius of curvature. This fact can come in very handy remember if you know one then you know the other Definition: Focal Point The focal point of mirror is the midpoint of line segment joining the vertex and the centre of curvature. It is the position at which all parallel rays are focussed. Why are we making such big deal about this point we call the focal point? It has an important property we will use often. ray parallel to the principal axis hitting the mirror will always be reflected through the focal point. The focal point is the position at which all parallel rays are focussed. Figure 7.19: concave mirror with three rays drawn to locate the image. Each incident ray is reflected according to the Law of Reflection. The intersection of the reflected rays gives the location of the image. Here the image is real and inverted. From Figure 7.19 we see that the image created by concave mirror is real and inverted as compared to the virtual and erect image created by plane mirror. Definition: Real Image real image can be cast on screen it is inverted and on the same side of the mirror as the object. ,The first type of Curved mirror we will study are Curved mirror Curved mirror have the shape shown in Figure 7.17.

It is the Position (vector) at which all parallel Ray (optics) are focussed. Why are we making such big deal about this point we call the focal point? It has an important property we will use often. Ray (optics) parallel to the principal axis hitting the mirror will always be Reflection (physics) through the focal point. The focal point is the Position (vector) at which all parallel Ray (optics) are focussed. Figure 7.19: Curved mirror with three Ray (optics) drawn to locate the image. Each incident Ray (optics) is Reflection (physics) according to Specular reflection The intersection of the Reflection (physics) Ray (optics) gives the location of the image. Here the image is real and inverted.

Once we have done that it is easy to see what properties the image has. First we need to define very important characteristic of the mirror. We have seen that the centre of curvature is the centre of the sphere from which the mirror is cut. We then define that <b>Distance</b> that is half-way between the centre of curvature and the mirror on the principal axis. This point is known as the focal point and the <b>Distance</b> from the focal point to the mirror is known as the focal <b>Length</b> (symbol f).

As with plane mirror the principal axis is line that is perpendicular to the centre of the mirror. We have defined the focal point as that point that is half-way along the principal axis between the centre of curvature and the mirror. Now for convex mirror this point is behind the mirror. convex mirror has negative focal length because the focal point is behind the mirror. Figure 7.20: Convex mirror with principle axis focal point (F) and centre of curvature (C). The centre of the mirror is the optical centre (O). To determine what the image from convex mirror looks like and where the image is located we need to remember that mirror obeys the laws of reflection and that light appears to come from the image. The image created by convex mirror is shown in Figure 7.21. Figure 7.21: convex mirror with three rays drawn to locate the image. Each incident ray is reflected according to the Law of Reflection. The reflected rays diverge. If the reflected rays are extended behind the mirror then their intersection gives the location of the image behind the mirror. For convex mirror the image is virtual and upright. From Figure 7.21 we see that the image created by convex mirror is virtual and upright as compared to the real and inverted image created by concave mirror. Extension: Divergence convex mirror is also known as diverging mirror. Light rays appear to diverge from the focal point of convex mirror. ,The second type of Curved mirror we will study are Curved mirror Curved mirror have the shape shown in Figure 7.20.

101,101,7.6,Total Internal Reflection and Fibre Optics,156,,,
102,102,7.6.1,Total Internal Reflection,156,When we increase the angle of incidence we reach point where the angle of refraction is 90 and the refracted ray runs along the surface of the medium. This angle of incidence is called the critical angle. Definition: Critical Angle The critical angle is the angle of incidence where the angle of reflection is 90. The light must shine from dense to less dense medium. If the angle of incidence is bigger than this critical angle the refracted ray will not emerge from the medium but will be reflected back into the medium. This is called total internal reflection. Total internal reflection takes place when light shines from an optically denser medium to an optically less dense medium. the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle. Definition: Total Internal Reflection Total internal reflection takes place when light is reflected back into the medium because the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle. Each medium has its own unique critical angle. For example the critical angle for glass is 42 and that of water is 488. We can calculate the critical angle for any medium. Calculating the Critical Angle Now we shall learn how to derive the value of the critical angle for two given media. The process is fairly simple and involves just the use of Snells Law that we have already studied. To recap Snells Law states: n1 sin n2 sin where n1 is the refractive index of material n2 is the refractive index of material is the angle of incidence and is the angle of refraction. For total internal reflection we know that the angle of incidence is the critical angle. So c. However we also know that the angle of refraction at the critical angle is 90. So we have: 90. We can then write Snells Law as: n1 sin n2 sin 90 Solving for gives: n1 sin n2 sin 90 sin n2 n1 (1) sin1 n2 n1 Important: Take care that for total internal reflection the incident ray is always in the denser medium. ,When we increase the Angle of incidence we reach point where the angle of Refraction is 90 and the Refraction Ray (optics) runs along the surface of the medium.

103,103,7.6.2,Fibre Optics,161,Total internal reflection is powerful tool since it can be used to confine light. One of the most common applications of total internal reflection is in fibre optics. An optical fibre is thin transparent fibre usually made of glass or plastic for transmitting light. Optical fibres are usually thinner than human hair The construction of single optical fibre is shown in Figure 7.23. The basic functional structure of an optical fibre consists of an outer protective cladding and an inner core through which light pulses travel. The overall diameter of the fibre is about 125 (125106m) and that of the core is just about 10 (10106m). The mode of operation of the optical fibres as mentioned above depends on the phenomenon of total internal reflection. The difference in refractive index of the cladding and the core allows total internal reflection in the same way as happens at an air-water surface. If light is incident on cable end with an angle of incidence greater than the critical angle then the light will remain trapped inside the glass strand. In this way light travels very quickly down the length of the cable. Fibre Optics in Telecommunications Optical fibres are most common in telecommunications because information can be transported over long distances with minimal loss of data. The minimised loss of data gives optical fibres an advantage over conventional cables. Data is transmitted from one end of the fibre to another in the form of laser pulses. single strand is capable of handling over 3000 simultaneous transmissions which is huge improvement over the conventional co-axial cables. Multiple signal transmission is achieved by sending individual light pulses at slightly different angles. For example if one of the pulses makes 7223 angle of incidence then separate pulse can be sent at an angle of 7226 The transmitted data is received almost instantaneously at the other end of the cable since the information coded onto the laser travels at the speed of light During transmission over long distances repeater stations are used to amplify the signal which has weakened somewhat by the time it reaches the station. The amplified signals are then relayed towards their destination and may encounter several other repeater stations on the way. Fibre Optics in Medicine Optic fibres are used in medicine in endoscopes. The main part of an endoscope is the optical fibre. Light is shone down the optical fibre and medical doctor can use the endoscope to look inside patient. Endoscopes are used to examine the inside of patients stomach by inserting the endoscope down the patients throat. Endoscopes allow minimally invasive surgery. This means that person can be diagnosed and treated through small incision. This has advantages over open surgery because endoscopy is quicker and cheaper and the patient recovers more quickly. The alternative is open surgery which is expensive requires more time and is more traumatic for the patient. Endoscopy means to look inside and refers to looking inside the human body for diagnosing medical conditions. ,Total internal Reflection (physics) is Power (physics) tool since it can be used to confine Light One of the most common applications of total internal Reflection (physics) is in fibre Geometrical optics An Geometrical optics fibre is thin transparent fibre usually made of glass or Plasticity (physics) for transmitting Light Geometrical optics fibres are usually thinner than human hair The construction of single Geometrical optics fibre is shown in Figure 7.23.

106,106,8.2,Magnetic fields,167,magnetic field is region in space where magnet or object made of ferromagnetic material will experience non-contact force. Electrons moving inside any object have magnetic fields associated with them. In most materials these fields point in all directions so the net magnetic field is zero. For example in the plastic ball below the directions of the magnetic fields of the electrons (shown by the arrows) are pointing in different directions and cancel each other out. Therefore the plastic ball is not magnetic and has no magnetic field. In some materials (e.g. iron) called ferromagnetic materials there are regions called domains where these magnetic fields line up. All the atoms in each domain group together so that the magnetic fields from their electrons point the same way. The picture shows piece of an iron needle zoomed in to show the domains with the electric fields lined up inside them. In permanent magnets many domains are lined up resulting in net magnetic field. Objects made from ferromagnetic materials can be magnetised for example by rubbing magnet along the object in one direction. This causes the magnetic fields of most or all of the domains to line up and cause the object to have magnetic field and be magnetic. Once ferromagnetic object has been magnetised it can stay magnetic without another magnet being nearby (i.e. without being in another magnetic field). In the picture below the needle has been magnetised because the magnetic fields in all the domains are pointing in the same direction. ,Magnet Field (physics) is region in space where Magnet or object made of ferromagnetic material will experience non-contact Force Electron moving inside any object have Magnet Field (physics) associated with them.

107,107,8.3,Permanent magnets,169,,,
108,108,8.3.1,The poles of permanent magnets,169,Because the domains in permanent magnet all line up in particular direction the magnet has pair of opposite poles called north (usually shortened to N) and south (usually shortened to S). Even if the magnet is cut into tiny pieces each piece will still have both and pole. These poles always occur in pairs. In nature we never find north magnetic pole or south magnetic pole on its own. Magnetic fields are different to gravitational and electric fields. In nature positive and negative electric charges can be found on their own but you never find just north magnetic pole or south magnetic pole on its own. On the very small scale zooming in to the size of atoms magnetic fields are caused by moving charges (i.e. the negatively charged electrons). ,Because the domains in permanent Magnet all line up in particular Direction (geometry) the Magnet has pair of opposite poles called north (usually shortened to N) and south (usually shortened to S).

110,110,8.3.3,Representing magnetic fields,170,Magnetic fields can be represented using magnetic field lines. Although the magnetic field of permanent magnet is everywhere surrounding the magnet (in all dimensions) we draw only some of the field lines to represent the field (usually only dimensions are shown in drawings). In areas where the magnetic field is strong the field lines are closer together. Where the field is weaker the field lines are drawn further apart. The strength of magnetic field is referred to as the magnetic flux Important: 1. Field lines never cross. 2. Arrows drawn on the field lines indicate the direction of the field. 3. magnetic field points from the north to the south pole of magnet. As the activity shows one can map the magnetic field of magnet by placing it underneath piece of paper and sprinkling iron filings on top. The iron filings line themselves up parallel to the magnetic field. Another tool one can use to find the direction of magnetic field is compass. The compass arrow points in the direction of the field. As already said opposite poles of magnet attract each other and bringing them together causes their magnetic field lines to converge (come together). Like poles of magnet repel each other and bringing them together causes their magnetic field lines to diverge (bend out from each other). Extension: Ferromagnetism and Retentivity Ferromagnetism is phenomenon shown by materials like iron nickel or cobalt. These materials can form permanent magnets. They always magnetise so as to be attracted to magnet no matter which magnetic pole is brought toward the unmagnetised ironnickelcobalt. The ability of ferromagnetic material to retain its magnetisation after an external field is removed is called its retentivity. Paramagnetic materials are materials like aluminium or platinum which become magnetised in an external magnetic field in similar way to ferromagnetic materials. However they lose their magnetism when the external magnetic field is removed. Diamagnetism is shown by materials like copper or bismuth which become mag- netised in magnetic field with polarity opposite to the external magnetic field. Unlike iron they are slightly repelled by magnet. ,Magnet Field (physics) can be represented using Magnet Field (physics) lines.

111,111,8.4,The compass and the earth's magnetic field,173,compass is an instrument which is used to find the direction of magnetic field. It can do this because compass consists of small metal needle which is magnetised itself and which is free to turn in any direction. Therefore when in the presence of magnetic field the needle is able to line up in the same direction as the field. Lodestone magnetised form of iron-oxide was found to orientate itself in north-south direction if left free to rotate by suspension on string or on float in water. Lodestone was therefore used as an early navigational compass. Compasses are mainly used in navigation to find direction on the earth. This works because the earth itself has magnetic field which is similar to that of bar magnet (see the picture below). The compass needle aligns with the magnetic field direction and points north (or south). Once you know where north is you can figure out any other direction. picture of compass is shown below: Some animals can detect magnetic fields which helps them orientate themselves and find di- rection. Animals which can do this include pigeons bees Monarch butterflies sea turtles and fish. ,Compass is an instrument which is used to find the Direction (geometry) of Magnet Field (physics) It can do this because Compass consists of small metal needle which is magnetised itself and which is free to turn in any Direction (geometry) Therefore when in the presence of Magnet Field (physics) the needle is able to line up in the same Direction (geometry) as the Field (physics) Lodestone magnetised form of iron-oxide was found to orientate itself in north-south Direction (geometry) if left free to rotate by suspension on string or on float in water.

112,112,8.4.1,The earth's magnetic field,175,In the picture below you can see representation of the earths magnetic field which is very similar to the magnetic field of giant bar magnet like the one on the right of the picture. So the earth has two sets of north poles and south poles: geographic poles and magnetic poles. The earths magnetic field is thought to be caused by churning liquid metals in the core which causes electric currents and magnetic field. From the picture you can see that the direction of magnetic north and true north are not identical. The geographic north pole which is the point through which the earths rotation axis goes is about 115o away from the direction of the magnetic north pole (which is where compass will point). However the magnetic poles shift slightly all the time. Another interesting thing to note is that if we think of the earth as big bar magnet and we know that magnetic field lines always point from north to south then the compass tells us that what we call the magnetic north pole is actually the south pole of the bar magnet The direction of the earths magnetic field flips direction about once every 200 000 years You can picture this as bar magnet whose north and south pole periodically switch sides. The reason for this is still not fully understood. The earths magnetic field is very important for humans and other animals on earth because it stops charged particles emitted by the sun from hitting the earth and us. Charged particles can also damage and cause interference with telecommunications (such as cell phones). Charged particles (mainly protons and electrons) are emitted by the sun in what is called the solar wind and travel towards the earth. These particles spiral in the earths magnetic field towards the poles. If they collide with other particles in the earths atmosphere they sometimes cause red or green lights or glow in the sky which is called the aurora. This happens close to the north and south pole and so we cannot see the aurora from South Africa. ,In the picture below you can see representation of the earths Magnet Field (physics) which is very similar to the Magnet Field (physics) of giant bar Magnet like the one on the right of the picture.

115,115,9.2,Two kinds of charge,177,All objects surrounding us (including people) contain large amounts of electric charge. There are two types of electric charge: positive charge and negative charge. If the same amounts of negative and positive charge are brought together they neutralise each other and there is no net charge. Neutral objects are objects which contain positive and negative charges but in equal numbers. However if there is little bit more of one type of charge than the other on the object then the object is said to be electrically charged. The picture below shows what the distribution of charges might look like for neutral positively charged and negatively charged object. There are: positive charges and negative charges (-6) There is zero net charge: The object is neutral positive charges and negative charges (-6) The net charge is +2 The object is positively charged positive charges and negative charges (-9) -3 The net charge is -3 The object is negatively charged ,All objects surrounding us (including people) contain large amounts of Electric charge There are two types of Electric charge Position (vector) Electric charge and Electric charge If the same amounts of negative and Position (vector) Electric charge are brought together they neutralise each other and there is no net Electric charge Neutral objects are objects which contain Position (vector) and Electric charge but in equal numbers.

116,116,9.3,Unit of charge,177,Charge is measured in units called coulombs (C). coulomb of charge is very large charge. In electrostatics we therefore often work with charge in microcoulombs (1 106 C) and nanocoulombs (1 nC 109 C). ,Electric charge is measured in units called Coulomb (C).

117,117,9.4,Conservation of charge,177,Objects can become charged by contact or by rubbing them. This means that they can gain extra negative or positive charge. Charging happens when you for example rub your feet against the carpet. When you then touch something metallic or another person you will feel shock as the excess charge that you have collected is discharged. Important: Charge just like energy cannot be created or destroyed. We say that charge is conserved. When you rub your feet against the carpet negative charge is transferred to you from the carpet. The carpet will then become positively charged by the same amount. Another example is to take two neutral objects such as plastic ruler and cotton cloth (handkerchief). To begin the two objects are neutral (i.e. have the same amounts of positive and negative charge.) +- +- +- +- -+- +- The ruler has postive charges and The neutral cotton cloth has positive charges and negative charges The total number of charges is: (9+5)14 positive charges (9+5)14 negative charges negative charges BEFORE rubbing: Now if the cotton cloth is used to rub the ruler negative charge is transferred from the cloth to the ruler. The ruler is now negatively charged and the cloth is positively charged. If you count up all the positive and negative charges at the beginning and the end there are still the same amount. i.e. total charge has been conserved +- +- +- +- -+- +- The ruler has postive charges and The cotton cloth has positive charges and negative charges. The total number of charges is: (9+5)14 positive charges (12+2)14 negative charges 12 negative charges AFTER rubbing: It is now positively charged. ,Objects can become Electric charge by contact or by rubbing them.

118,118,9.5,Force between Charges,178,The force exerted by non-moving (static) charges on each other is called the electrostatic force. The electrostatic force between: like charges is repulsive opposite (unlike) charges is attractive. In other words like charges repel each other while opposite charges attract each other. This is different to the gravitational force which is only attractive. attractive force repulsive force repulsive force The closer together the charges are the stronger the electrostatic force between them. weaker repulsive force stronger repulsive force (shorter distance between charges) (longer distance between charges) Extension: Electrostatic Force The electrostatic force determines the arrangement of charge on the surface of con- ductors. When we place charge on spherical conductor the repulsive forces between the individual like charges cause them to spread uniformly over the sur- face of the sphere. However for conductors with non-regular shapes there is concentration of charge near the point or points of the object. This collection of charge can actually allow charge to leak off the conductor if the point is sharp enough. It is for this reason that buildings often have lightning rod on the roof to remove any charge the building has collected. This minimises the possibility of the building being struck by lightning. This spreading out of charge would not occur if we were to place the charge on an insulator since charge cannot move in insulators. The word electron comes from the Greek word for amber. The ancient Greeks observed that if you rubbed piece of amber you could use it to pick up bits of straw. ,The Force exerted by non-moving (static) Electric charge on each other is called the Electrostatics Force The Electrostatics Force between: like Electric charge is repulsive opposite (unlike) Electric charge is attractive.

119,119,9.6,Conductors and insulators,181,All atoms are electrically neutral i.e. they have the same amounts of negative and positive charge inside them. By convention the electrons carry negative charge and the protons carry positive charge. The basic unit of charge called the elementary charge is the amount of charge carried by one electron. All the matter and materials on earth are made up of atoms. Some materials allow electrons to move relatively freely through them (e.g. most metals the human body). These materials are called conductors. Other materials do not allow the charge carriers the electrons to move through them (e.g. plastic glass). The electrons are bound to the atoms in the material. These materials are called non-conductors or insulators. If an excess of charge is placed on an insulator it will stay where it is put and there will be concentration of charge in that area of the object. However if an excess of charge is placed on conductor the like charges will repel each other and spread out over the surface of the object. When two conductors are made to touch the total charge on them is shared between the two. If the two conductors are identical then each conductor will be left with half of the total charge. Extension: Charge and electrons The basic unit of charge namely the elementary charge is carried by the electron (equal to 1.6021019 C). In conducting material (e.g. copper) when the atoms bond to form the material some of the outermost loosely bound electrons become detached from the individual atoms and so become free to move around. The charge carried by these electrons can move around in the material. In insulators there are very few if any free electrons and so the charge cannot move around in the material. ,All atoms are Electric charge i.e. they have the same amounts of negative and Position (vector) Electric charge inside them.

120,120,9.6.1,The electroscope,182,The electroscope is very sensitive instrument which can be used to detect electric charge. diagram of gold leaf electroscope is shown the figure below. The electroscope consists of glass container with metal rod inside which has thin pieces of gold foil attached. The other end of the metal rod has metal plate attached to it outside the glass container. The electroscope detects charge in the following way: charged object like the positively charged rod in the picture is brought close to (but not touching) the neutral metal plate of the electroscope. This causes negative charge in the gold foil metal rod and metal plate to be attracted to the positive rod. Because the metal (gold is metal too) is conductor the charge can move freely from the foil up the metal rod and onto the metal plate. There is now more negative charge on the plate and more positive charge on the gold foil leaves. This is called inducing charge on the metal plate. It is important to remember that the electroscope is still neutral (the total positive and negative charges are the same) the charges have just been induced to move to different parts of the instrument The induced positive charge on the gold leaves forces them apart since like charges repel This is how we can tell that the rod is charged. If the rod is now moved away from the metal plate the charge in the electroscope will spread itself out evenly again and the leaves will fall down again because there will no longer be an induced charge on them. Grounding If you were to bring the charged rod close to the uncharged electroscope and then you touched the metal plate with your finger at the same time this would cause charge to flow up from the ground (the earth) through your body onto the metal plate. This is called grounding. The charge flowing onto the plate is opposite to the charge on the rod since it is attracted to the rod. Therefore for our picture the charge flowing onto the plate would be negative. Now charge has been added to the electroscope. It is no longer neutral but has an excess of negative charge. Now if we move the rod away the leaves will remain apart because they have an excess of negative charge and they repel each other. ,The Electroscope is very sensitive instrument which can be used to detect Electric charge diagram of gold leaf Electroscope is shown the figure below.

122,122,9.7.1,Polarisation of Insulators,183,Unlike conductors the electrons in insulators (non-conductors) are bound to the atoms of the insulator and cannot move around freely in the material. However charged object can still exert force on neutral insulator through the concept of polarisation. If positively charged rod is brought close to neutral insulator such as polystyrene it can attract the bound electrons to move round to the side of the atoms which is closest to the rod and cause the positive nuclei to move slightly to the opposite side of the atoms. This process is called polarisation. Although it is very small (microscopic) effect if there are many atoms and the polarised object is light (e.g. small polystyrene ball) it can add up to enough force to be attracted onto the charged rod. Remember that the polystyrene is only polarised not charged. The polystyrene ball is still neutral since no charge was added or removed from it. The picture shows not-to-scale view of the polarised atoms in the polystyrene ball: Some materials are made up of molecules which are already polarised. These are molecules which have more positive and more negative side but are still neutral overall. Just as polarised polystyrene ball can be attracted to charged rod these materials are also affected if brought close to charged object. Water is an example of substance which is made of polarised molecules. If positively charged rod is brought close to stream of water the molecules can rotate so that the negative sides all line up towards the rod. The stream of water will then be attracted to the rod since opposite charges attract. ,Unlike Electrical conductor the Electron in Insulator (electricity) (non-conductors) are bound to the atoms of the Insulator (electricity) and cannot move around freely in the material.

Think of it as though charge is at rest and something has to push it along. This means that work needs to be done to make charge move. force acts on the charges doing work to make them move. The force is provided by the battery in the circuit. We call the moving charge current and we will talk about this later. The position of the charge in the circuit tells you how much potential energy it has because of the force being exerted on it. This is like the force from gravity the higher an object is above the ground (position) the more potential energy it has. The amount of work to move charge from one point to another point is how much the potential energy has changed. This is the difference in potential energy called potential difference. Notice that it is difference between the value of potential energy at two points so we say that potential difference is measured between or across two points. We do not say potential difference through something.

129,129,10.2.2,Potential Difference and Parallel Resistors,193,When resistors are connected in parallel the start and end points for all the resistors are the same. These points have the same potential energy and so the potential difference between them is the same no matter what is put in between them. You can have one two or many resistors between the two points the potential difference will not change. You can ignore whatever components are between two points in circuit when calculating the difference between the two points. Look at the following circuit diagrams.

All points on the wires that have no circuit components between them will give you the same measurements. All three of the measurements shown in the picture below will give you the same voltages.

You can have one two or many resistors between the two points the <b>Voltage</b> will not change. You can ignore whatever components are between two points in circuit when calculating the difference between the two points. Look at the following circuit diagrams. The battery is the same in all cases all that changes is more resistors are added between the points marked by the black dots. If we were to measure the <b>Voltage</b> between the two dots in these circuits we would get the same answer for all three cases. Lets look at two resistors in parallel more closely. When you construct circuit you use wires and you might think that measuring the <b>Voltage</b> in different places on the wires will make difference. This is not true. The <b>Voltage</b> or <b>Voltage</b> measurement will only be different if you measure different set of components. All points on the wires that have no circuit components between them will give you the same measurements. All three of the measurements shown in the picture below will give you the same <b>Voltage</b> The different measurement points on the left have no components between them so there is no change in <b>Potential energy</b> Exactly the same applies to the different points on the right. When you measure the <b>Voltage</b> between the points on the left and right you will get the same answer.

If we measured the potential difference between the black dots in all of these circuits it would be the same just like we saw above. So we now know the total potential difference is the same across one two or three resistors.

The arrows in this picture show you the direction that charge will flow in the circuit. They dont show you much charge will flow only the direction. Benjamin Franklin made guess about the direction of charge flow when rubbing smooth wax with rough wool. He thought that the charges flowed from the wax to the wool (i.e. from positive to negative) which was opposite to the real direction. Due to this electrons are said to have negative charge and so objects which Ben Franklin called negative (meaning shortage of charge) really have an excess of electrons. By the time the true direction of electron flow was discovered the convention of positive and negative had already been so well accepted in the scientific world that no effort was made to change it.

138,138,10.4,Resistance,202,,,
139,139,10.4.1,What causes resistance?,202,We have spoken about resistors that slow down the flow of charge in conductor. On microscopic level electrons moving through the conductor collide with the particles of which the conductor (metal) is made. When they collide they transfer kinetic energy. The electrons therefore lose kinetic energy and slow down. This leads to resistance. The transferred energy causes the conductor to heat up. You can feel this directly if you touch cellphone charger when you are charging cell phone the charger gets warm Definition: Resistance Resistance slows down the flow of charge in circuit. We use the symbol to show resistance and it is measured in units called Ohms with the symbol Ohm Volt Ampere All conductors have some resistance. For example piece of wire has less resistance than light bulb but both have resistance. The high resistance of the filament (small wire) in lightbulb causes the electrons to transfer lot of their kinetic energy in the form of heat. The heat energy is enough to cause the filament to glow white-hot which produces light. The wires connecting the lamp to the cell or battery hardly even get warm while conducting the same amount of current. This is because of their much lower resistance due to their larger cross-section (they are thicker). An important effect of resistor is that it converts electrical energy into other forms of energy such as heat and light. There is special type of conductor called superconductor that has no resistance but the materials that make up superconductors only start supercon- ducting at very low temperatures (approximately -170C). Why do batteries go flat? battery stores chemical potential energy. When it is connected in circuit chemical reaction takes place inside the battery which converts chemical potential energy to electrical energy which powers the electrons to move through the circuit. All the circuit elements (such as the conducting leads resistors and lightbulbs) have some resistance to the flow of charge and convert the electrical energy to heat andor light.

144,144,10.5.3,Ohmmeter,204,An ohmmeter is an instrument for measuring electrical resistance. The basic ohmmeter can function much like an ammeter. The ohmmeter works by suppling constant voltage to the resistor and measuring the current flowing through it. The measured current is then converted into corresponding resistance reading through Ohms Law. Ohmmeters only function correctly when measuring resistance that is not being powered by voltage or current source. In other words you cannot measure the resistance of component that is already connected to circuit. This is because the ohmmeters accurate indication depends only on its own source of voltage. The presence of any other voltage across the measured circuit component interferes with the ohmmeters operation.

148,148,11.2,Scalars and Vectors,211,In Mathematics you learned that number is something that represents quantity. For example if you have books apples and bicycle the and represent how many of each item you have. These kinds of numbers are known as scalars.

154,154,11.4.2,Compass Directions,213,Another common method of expressing direc- tions is to use the points of compass: North South East and West. If vector does not point exactly in one of the compass directions then we use an angle. For example we can have vector pointing 40 North of West. Start with the vector pointing along the West direction: Then rotate the vector towards the north until there is 40 angle between the vector and the West. The direction of this vector can also be described as: 40 (West 40 North) or 50 (North 50 West) ,Another common method of expressing direc- tions is to use the points of Compass North South East and West.

156,156,11.5,Drawing Vectors,214,In order to draw vector accurately we must specify scale and include reference direction in the diagram. scale allows us to translate the length of the arrow into the vectors magnitude. For instance if one chose scale of cm (1 cm represents N) force of 20 towards the East would be represented as an arrow 10 cm long. reference direction may be line representing horizontal surface or the points of compass. Method: Drawing Vectors 1. Decide upon scale and write it down. 2. Determine the length of the arrow representing the vector by using the scale. 3. Draw the vector as an arrow.

157,157,11.6,Mathematical Properties of Vectors,215,Vectors are mathematical objects and we need to understand the mathematical properties of vectors like adding and subtracting. For all the examples in this section we will use displacement as our vector quantity. Displacement was discussed in Chapter 3. Displacement is defined as the distance together with direction of the straight line joining final point to an initial point. Remember that displacement is just one example of vector. We could just as well have decided to use forces or velocities to illustrate the properties of vectors. ,Euclidean vector are mathematical objects and we need to understand the mathematical properties of Euclidean vector like adding and subtracting.

158,158,11.6.1,Adding Vectors,215,When vectors are added we need to add both magnitude and direction. For example take steps in the forward direction stop and then take another steps in the forward direction. The first steps is displacement vector and the second steps is also displacement vector. If we did not stop after the first steps we would have taken steps in the forward direction in total. Therefore if we add the displacement vectors for steps and steps we should get total of steps in the forward direction. Graphically this can be seen by first following the first vector two steps forward and then following the second one three steps forward: We add the second vector at the end of the first vector since this is where we now are after the first vector has acted. The vector from the tail of the first vector (the starting point) to the head of the last (the end point) is then the sum of the vectors. This is the head-to-tail method of vector addition. As you can convince yourself the order in which you add vectors does not matter. In the example above if you decided to first go steps forward and then another steps forward the end result would still be steps forward. The final answer when adding vectors is called the resultant. The resultant displacement in this case will be steps forward. Definition: Resultant of Vectors The resultant of number of vectors is the single vector whose effect is the same as the individual vectors acting together. In other words the individual vectors can be replaced by the resultant the overall effect is the same. If vectors and have resultant this can be represented mathematically as Let us consider some more examples of vector addition using displacements. The arrows tell you how far to move and in what direction. Arrows to the right correspond to steps forward while arrows to the left correspond to steps backward. Look at all of the examples below and check them. This example says step forward and then another step forward is the same as an arrow twice as long two steps forward. This examples says step backward and then another step backward is the same as an arrow twice as long two steps backward. It is sometimes possible that you end up back where you started. In this case the net result of what you have done is that you have gone nowhere (your start and end points are at the same place). In this case your resultant displacement is vector with length zero units. We use the symbol to denote such vector: It is important to realise that the directions are not special forward and backwards or left and right are treated in the same way. The same is true of any set of parallel directions: In the above examples the separate displacements were parallel to one another. However the same head-to-tail technique of vector addition can be applied to vectors in any direction. Now you have discovered one use for vectors describing resultant displacement how far and in what direction you have travelled after series of movements. Although vector addition here has been demonstrated with displacements all vectors behave in exactly the same way. Thus if given number of forces acting on body you can use the same method to determine the resultant force acting on the body. We will return to vector addition in more detail later. ,When Euclidean vector are added we need to add both magnitude and Direction (geometry) For example take steps in the forward Direction (geometry) stop and then take another steps in the forward Direction (geometry) The first steps is Displacement (vector) Euclidean vector and the second steps is also Displacement (vector) Euclidean vector If we did not stop after the first steps we would have taken steps in the forward Direction (geometry) in total.

159,159,11.6.2,Subtracting Vectors,217,What does it mean to subtract vector? Well this is really simple if we have apples and we subtract apples we have only apples left. Now lets work in steps if we take steps forward and then subtract steps forward we are left with only two steps forward: What have we done? You originally took steps forward but then you took steps back. That backward displacement would be represented by an arrow pointing to the left (backwards) with length 3. The net result of adding these two vectors is steps forward: Thus subtracting vector from another is the same as adding vector in the opposite direction (i.e. subtracting steps forwards is the same as adding steps backwards). Important: Subtracting vector from another is the same as adding vector in the opposite direction. This suggests that in this problem to the right was chosen as the positive direction. Arrows to the right are positive and arrows to the left are negative. More generally vectors in opposite directions differ in sign (i.e. if we define up as positive then vectors acting down are negative). Thus changing the sign of vector simply reverses its direction: ,What does it mean to subtract Euclidean vector Well this is really simple if we have apples and we subtract apples we have only apples left.

More generally Euclidean vector in opposite Direction (geometry) differ in sign (i.e. if we define up as Position (vector) then Euclidean vector acting down are negative). Thus changing the sign of Euclidean vector simply reverses its Direction (geometry) ,What does it mean to subtract <b>Euclidean vector</b> Well this is really simple if we have apples and we subtract apples we have only apples left. Now lets <b>Work (physics)</b> in steps if we take steps forward and then subtract steps forward we are left with only two steps forward: What have we done? You originally took steps forward but then you took steps back. That backward <b>Displacement (vector)</b> would be represented by an arrow pointing to the left (backwards) with <b>Length</b> 3.

162,162,11.7.1,Graphical Techniques,218,Graphical techniques involve drawing accurate scale diagrams to denote individual vectors and their resultants. We next discuss the two primary graphical techniques the head-to-tail technique and the parallelogram method. The Head-to-Tail Method In describing the mathematical properties of vectors we used displacements and the head-to-tail graphical method of vector addition as an illustration. The head-to-tail method of graphically adding vectors is standard method that must be understood. Method: Head-to-Tail Method of Vector Addition 1. Choose scale and include reference direction. 2. Choose any of the vectors and draw it as an arrow in the correct direction and of the correct length remember to put an arrowhead on the end to denote its direction. 3. Take the next vector and draw it as an arrow starting from the arrowhead of the first vector in the correct direction and of the correct length. 4. Continue until you have drawn each vector each time starting from the head of the previous vector. In this way the vectors to be added are drawn one after the other head- to-tail. 5. The resultant is then the vector drawn from the tail of the first vector to the head of the last. Its magnitude can be determined from the length of its arrow using the scale. Its direction too can be determined from the scale diagram. The Parallelogram Method The parallelogram method is another graphical technique of finding the resultant of two vectors. Method: The Parallelogram Method 1. Choose scale and reference direction. 2. Choose either of the vectors to be added and draw it as an arrow of the correct length in the correct direction. 3. Draw the second vector as an arrow of the correct length in the correct direction from the tail of the first vector. 4. Complete the parallelogram formed by these two vectors. 5. The resultant is then the diagonal of the parallelogram. The magnitude can be determined from the length of its arrow using the scale. The direction too can be determined from the scale diagram. The parallelogram method is restricted to the addition of just two vectors. However it is arguably the most intuitive way of adding two forces acting at point. ,Graphical techniques involve drawing accurate scale diagrams to denote individual Euclidean vector and their resultants.

In that case displacements east are negative. 2. Next simply add (or subtract) the vectors using the appropriate signs. 3. As final step the direction of the resultant should be included in words (positive answers are in the positive direction while negative resultants are in the negative direction). In the previous example we were able to use simple trigonometry to calculate the resultant displacement. This was possible since the directions of motion were perpendicular (north and east). Algebraic techniques however are not limited to cases where the vectors to be combined are along the same straight line or at right angles to one another.

164,164,11.8,Components of Vectors,228,In the discussion of vector addition we saw that number of vectors acting together can be combined to give single vector (the resultant). In much the same way single vector can be broken down into number of vectors which when added give that original vector. These vectors which sum to the original are called components of the original vector. The process of breaking vector into its components is called resolving into components. While summing given set of vectors gives just one answer (the resultant) single vector can be resolved into infinitely many sets of components. In the diagrams below the same black vector is resolved into different pairs of components. These components are shown as dashed lines. When added together the dashed vectors give the original black vector (i.e. the original vector is the resultant of its components). In practice it is most useful to resolve vector into components which are at right angles to one another usually horizontal and vertical. Any vector can be resolved into horizontal and vertical component. If is vector then the horizontal component of is Ax and the vertical component is Ay. ,In the discussion of Euclidean vector addition we saw that number of Euclidean vector acting together can be combined to give single Euclidean vector (the resultant).

165,165,11.8.1,Vector addition using components,231,Components can also be used to find the resultant of vectors. This technique can be applied to both graphical and algebraic methods of finding the resultant. The method is simple: make rough sketch of the problem find the horizontal and vertical components of each vector find the sum of all horizontal components and the sum of all the vertical components and then use them to find the resultant. Consider the two vectors and in Figure 11.3 together with their resultant R. Each vector in Figure 11.3 can be broken down into component in the x-direction and one in the y-direction.

169,169,12.2.1,What is a force?,239,force is anything that can cause change to objects. Forces can: change the shape of an object move or stop an object change the direction of moving object. force can be classified as either contact force or non-contact force. contact force must touch or be in contact with an object to cause change. Examples of contact forces are: the force that is used to push or pull things like on door to open or close it the force that sculptor uses to turn clay into pot the force of the wind to turn windmill non-contact force does not have to touch an object to cause change. Examples of non- contact forces are: the force due to gravity like the Earth pulling the Moon towards itself the force due to electricity like proton and an electron attracting each other the force due to magnetism like magnet pulling paper clip towards itself The unit of force is the newton (symbol N). This unit is named after Sir Isaac Newton who first defined force. Force is vector quantity and has magnitude and direction. We use the abbreviation for force. There is popular story that while Sir Isaac Newton was sitting under an apple tree an apple fell on his head and he suddenly thought of the Universal Law of Gravitation. Coincidently the weight of small apple is approximately N. Force was first described by Archimedes of Syracuse (circa 287 BC 212 BC). Archimedes was Greek mathematician astronomer philosopher physicist and engineer. He was killed by Roman soldier during the sack of the city despite orders from the Roman general Marcellus that he was not to be harmed. This chapter will often refer to the resultant force acting on an object. The resultant force is simply the vector sum of all the forces acting on the object. It is very important to remember that all the forces must be acting on the same object.

170,170,12.2.2,Examples of Forces in Physics,240,Most of Physics revolves around forces. Although there are many different forces all are handled in the same way. All forces in Physics can be put into one of four groups. These are gravitational forces electromagnetic forces strong nuclear force and weak nuclear force. You will mostly come across gravitational or electromagnetic forces at school. Gravitational Forces Gravity is the attractive force between two objects due to the mass of the objects. When you throw ball in the air its mass and the Earths mass attract each other which leads to force between them. The ball falls back towards the Earth and the Earth accelerates towards the ball. The movement of the Earth towards the ball is however so small that you couldnt possibly measure it. Electromagnetic Forces Almost all of the forces that we experience in everyday life are electromagnetic in origin. They have this unusual name because long ago people thought that electric forces and magnetic forces were different things. After much work and experimentation it has been realised that they are actually different manifestations of the same underlying theory. Electric or Electrostatic Forces If we have objects carrying electrical charge which are not moving then we are dealing with electrostatic forces (Coulombs Law). This force is actually much stronger than gravity. This may seem strange since gravity is obviously very powerful and holding balloon to the wall seems to be the most impressive thing electrostatic forces have done but if we think about it: for gravity to be detectable we need to have very large mass nearby. But balloon rubbed in someones hair can stick to wall with force so strong that it overcomes the force of gravitywith just the charges in the balloon and the wall Magnetic Forces The magnetic force is different manifestation of the electromagnetic force. It stems from the interaction between moving charges as opposed to the fixed charges involved in Coulombs Law. Examples of the magnetic force in action include magnets compassescar engines and computer data storage. Magnets are also used in the wrecking industry to pick up cars and move them around sites. Friction According to Newtons First Law (we will discuss this later in the chapter) an object moving without force acting on it will keep on moving. Then why does box sliding on table stop? The answer is friction. Friction arises from the interaction between the molecules on the bottom of box with the molecules on table. This interaction is electromagnetic in origin hence friction is just another view of the electromagnetic force. Later in this chapter we will discuss frictional forces little more. Drag Forces This is the force an object experiences while travelling through medium like an aeroplane flying through air. When something travels through the air it needs to displace air as it travels and because of this the air exerts force on the object. This becomes an important force when you move fast and lot of thought is taken to try and reduce the amount of drag force sports car or an aeroplane experiences. The drag force is very useful for parachutists. They jump from high altitudes and if there was no drag force then they would continue accelerating all the way to the ground. Parachutes are wide because the more surface area you show the greater the drag force and hence the slower you hit the ground. ,Most of Physics revolves around Force Although there are many different Force all are handled in the same way.

Then why does box sliding on table stop? The answer is <b>Friction</b> <b>Friction</b> arises from the interaction between the molecules on the bottom of box with the molecules on table.

Drag <b>Force</b> This is the <b>Force</b> an object experiences while travelling through medium like an aeroplane flying through air. When something travels through the air it needs to <b>Displacement (vector)</b> air as it travels and because of this the air exerts <b>Force</b> on the object. This becomes an important <b>Force</b> when you move fast and lot of thought is taken to try and reduce the amount of drag <b>Force</b> sports car or an aeroplane experiences. The drag <b>Force</b> is very useful for parachutists. They jump from high altitudes and if there was no drag <b>Force</b> then they would continue accelerating all the way to the ground. Parachutes are wide because the more surface area you show the greater the drag <b>Force</b> and hence the slower you hit the ground.
171,171,12.2.3,Systems and External Forces,241,The concepts of system and an external forces are very important in Physics. system is any collection of objects. If one draws an imaginary box around such system then an external force is one that is applied by an object or person outside the box. Imagine for example car pulling two trailers. If we draw box around the two trailers they can be considered closed system or unit. When we look at the forces on this closed system the following forces will apply: The force of the car pulling the unit (trailer and B) The force of friction between the wheels of the trailers and the road (opposite to the direction of motion) The force of the Earth pulling downwards on the system (gravity) The force of the road pushing upwards on the system These forces are called external forces to the system. The following forces will not apply: The force of pulling The force of pulling The force of friction between the wheels of the car and the road (opposite to the direction of motion) We can also draw box around trailer or in which case the forces will be different. If we consider trailer as system the following external forces will apply: The force of the car pulling on (towards the right) The force of pulling on (towards the left) The force of the Earth pulling downwards on the trailer (gravity) The force of the road pushing upwards on the trailer ,The concepts of system and an external Force are very important in Physics system is any collection of objects.

172,172,12.2.4,Force Diagrams,242,If we look at the example above and draw force diagram of all the forces acting on the two-trailer-unit the diagram would look like this: It is important to keep the following in mind when you draw force diagrams: Make your drawing large and clear. You must use arrows and the direction of the arrow will show the direction of the force. The length of the arrow will indicate the size of the force in other words the longer arrows in the diagram (F1 for example) indicates bigger force than shorter arrow (Ff ). Arrows of the same length indicate forces of equal size (FN and Fg). Use ?little lines? like in maths to show this. Draw neat lines using ruler. The arrows must touch the system or object. All arrows must have labels. Use letters with key on the side if you do not have enough space on your drawing. The labels must indicate what is applying the force (the force of the car?) on what the force is applied (?on the trailer?) and in which direction (to the right) If the values of the forces are known these values can be added to the diagram or key. ,If we look at the example above and draw Force diagram of all the Force acting on the two-trailer-unit the diagram would look like this: It is important to keep the following in mind when you draw Force diagrams: Make your drawing large and clear.

173,173,12.2.5,Free Body Diagrams,243,In free-body diagram the object of interest is drawn as dot and all the forces acting on it are drawn as arrows pointing away from the dot. free body diagram for the two-trailer-system will therefore look like this: ,In free-body diagram the object of interest is drawn as dot and all the Force acting on it are drawn as arrows pointing away from the dot.

174,174,12.2.6,Finding the Resultant Force,244,The easiest way to determine resultant force is to draw free body diagram. Remember from Chapter ?? that we use the length of the arrow to indicate the vectors magnitude and the direction of the arrow to show which direction it acts in. After we have done this we have diagram of vectors and we simply find the sum of the vectors to get the resultant force. Figure 12.1: (a) Force diagram of forces acting on box. (b) Free body diagram of the box. For example two people push on box from opposite sides with forces of and respectively as shown in Figure 12.1(a). The free body diagram in Figure 12.1(b) shows the object represented by dot and the two forces are represented by arrows with their tails on the dot. As you can see the arrows point in opposite directions and have different lengths. The resultant force is to the left. This result can be obtained algebraically too since the two forces act along the same line. First as in motion in one direction choose frame of reference. Secondly add the two vectors taking their directions into account. For the example assume that the positive direction is to the right then: FR (+4N) (6N) 2N 2N to the left Remember that negative answer means that the force acts in the opposite direction to the one that you chose to be positive. You can choose the positive direction to be any way you want but once you have chosen it you must keep it. As you work with more force diagrams in which the forces exactly balance you may notice that you get zero answer (e.g. N). This simply means that the forces are balanced and that the object will not move. Once force diagram has been drawn the techniques of vector addition introduced in Chapter ?? can be used. Depending on the situation you might choose to use graphical technique such as the tail-to-head method or the parallelogram method or else an algebraic approach to determine the resultant. Since force is vector all of these methods apply. ,The easiest way to determine resultant Force is to draw Free body diagram Remember from Chapter ?? that we use the Length of the arrow to indicate the Euclidean vector magnitude and the Direction (geometry) of the arrow to show which Direction (geometry) it acts in.

176,176,12.3.1,Newton's First Law,247,Sir Isaac Newton was scientist who lived in England (1642-1727). He was interested in the reason why objects move. He suggested that objects that are stationary will remain stationary unless force acts on them and objects that are moving will keep on moving unless force slows them down speeds them up or let them change direction. From this he formulated what is known as Newtons First Law of Motion: Definition: Newtons First Law of Motion An object will remain in state of rest or continue traveling at constant velocity unless acted upon by an unbalanced (net) force. Let us consider the following situations: An ice skater pushes herself away from the side of the ice rink and skates across the ice. She will continue to move in straight line across the ice unless something stops her. Objects are also like that. If we kick soccer ball across soccer field according to Newtons First Law the soccer ball should keep on moving forever However in real life this does not happen. Is Newtons Law wrong? Not really. Newtons First Law applies to situations where there arent any external forces present. This means that friction is not present. In the case of the ice skater the friction between the skates and the ice is very little and she will continue moving for quite distance. In the case of the soccer ball air resistance (friction between the air and the ball) and friction between the grass and the ball is present and this will slow the ball down. Newtons First Law in action We experience Newtons First Law in every day life. Let us look at the following examples: Rockets: spaceship is launched into space. The force of the exploding gases pushes the rocket through the air into space. Once it is in space the engines are switched off and it will keep on moving at constant velocity. If the astronauts want to change the direction of the spaceship they need to fire an engine. This will then apply force on the rocket and it will change its direction. Seat belts: We wear seat belts in cars. This is to protect us when the car is involved in an accident. If car is traveling at 120 kmhr1 the passengers in the car is also traveling at 120 kmhr1. When the car suddenly stops force is exerted on the car (making it slow down) but not on the passengers. The passengers will carry on moving forward at 120 kmhr1according to Newton I. If they are wearing seat belts the seat belts will stop them and therefore prevent them from getting hurt. ,Sir Isaac Newton was scientist who lived in England (1642-1727).

177,177,12.3.2,Newton's Second Law of Motion,249,According to Newton things like to keep on doing what they are doing. In other words if an object is moving it likes to keep on moving and if an object is stationary it likes to stay stationary. So how do objects start to move then? Let us look at the example of 10 kg box on rough table. If we push lightly on the box as indicated in the diagram the box wont move. Lets say we applied force of 100 yet the box remains stationary. At this point frictional force of 100 is acting on the box preventing the box from moving. If we increase the force lets say to 150 and the box just about starts to move the frictional force is 150 N. To be able to move the box we need to push hard enough to overcome the friction and then move the box. If we therefore apply force of 200 remembering that frictional force of 150 is present the first 150 will be used to overcome or cancel the friction and the other 50 will be used to move (accelerate) the block. In order to accelerate an object we must have resultant force acting on the block. Now what do you think will happen if we pushed harder lets say 300 N? Or what do you think will happen if the mass of the block was more say 20 kg or what if it was less? Let us investigate how the motion of an object is affected by mass and force. You will have noted in the investigation above that the heavier the trolley is the slower it moved. The acceleration is indirectly proportional to the mass. In mathematical terms: In similar investigation where the mass is kept constant but the applied force is varied you will find that the bigger the force is the faster the object will move. The acceleration of the trolley is therefore directly proportional to the resultant force. In mathematical terms: F. If we rearrange the above equations we get OR ma Newton formulated his second law as follows: Definition: Newtons Second Law of Motion If resultant force acts on body it will cause the body to accelerate in the direction of the resultant force. The acceleration of the body will be directly proportional to the resultant force and indirectly proportional to the mass of the body. The mathematical representation is m. Applying Newtons Second Law Newtons Second Law can be applied to variety of situations. We will look at the main types of examples that you need to study. Object on an inclined plane When we place an object on slope the force of gravity (Fg) acts straight down and not perpendicular to the slope. Due to gravity pulling straight down the object will tend to slide down the slope with force equal to the horizontal component of the force of gravity (Fg sin ). The object will stick to the slope due to the frictional force between the object and the surface. As you increase the angle of the slope the horizontal component will also increase until the frictional force is overcome and the object starts to slide down the slope. The force of gravity will also tend to push an object into the slope. This force is equal to the vertical component of the force of gravity (Fg cos ). There is no movement in this direction as this force is balanced by the slope pushing up against the object. This ?pushing force? is called the normal force (N) and is equal to the resultant force in the vertical direction Fg sin in this case but opposite in direction. Important: Do not use the abbreviation for weight as it is used to abbreviate work. Rather use the force of gravity Fg for weight. Lifts and rockets So far we have looked at objects being pulled or pushed across surface in other words hori- zontal motion. Here we only considered horizontal forces but we can also lift objects up or let them fall. This is vertical motion where only vertical forces are being considered. Let us consider 500 kg lift with no passengers hanging on cable. The purpose of the cable is to pull the lift upwards so that it can reach the next floor or to let go little so that it can move downwards to the floor below. We will look at five possible stages during the motion of the lift. Stage 1: The 500 kg lift is stationary at the second floor of tall building. Because the lift is stationary (not moving) there is no resultant force acting on the lift. This means that the upward forces must be balanced by the downward forces. The only force acting down is the force of gravity which is equal to (500 98 4900 N) in this case. The cable must therefore pull upwards with force of 4900 to keep the lift stationary at this point. Stage 2: The lift moves upwards at an acceleration of ms2. If the lift is accelerating it means that there is resultant force in the direction of the motion. This means that the force acting upwards is now bigger than the force of gravity Fg (down). To find the magnitude of the force applied by the cable (Fc) we can do the following calculation: (Remember to choose direction as positive. We have chosen upwards as positive.) FR ma Fc Fg ma Fc (4900) (500)(1) Fc 5400 upwards The answer makes sense as we need bigger force upwards to cancel the effect of gravity as well as make the lift go faster. Stage 3: The lift moves at constant velocity. When the lift moves at constant velocity it means that all the forces are balanced and that there is no resultant force. The acceleration is zero therefore FR 0. The force acting upwards is equal to the force acting downwards therefore Fc 4900 N. Stage 4: The lift slow down at rate of 2ms2. As the lift is now slowing down there is resultant force downwards. This means that the force acting downwards is bigger than the force acting upwards. To find the magnitude of the force applied by the cable (Fc) we can do the following calculation: Again we have chosen upwards as positive which means that the acceleration will be negative number. This makes sense as we need smaller force upwards to ensure resultant force down. The force of gravity is now bigger than the upward pull of the cable and the lift will slow down. Stage 5: The cable snaps. When the cable snaps the force that used to be acting upwards is no longer present. The only force that is present would be the force of gravity. The lift will freefall and its acceleration can be calculated as follows: Rockets Like with lifts rockets are also examples of objects in vertical motion. The force of gravity pulls the rocket down while the thrust of the engine pushes the rocket upwards. The force that the engine exerts must overcome the force of gravity so that the rocket can accelerate upwards. The worked example below looks at the application of Newtons Second Law in launching rocket. ,According to Newton things like to keep on doing what they are doing. In other words if an object is moving it likes to keep on moving and if an object is stationary it likes to stay stationary. So how do objects start to move then? Let us look at the example of 10 Kilogram box on rough table. If we push lightly on the box as indicated in the diagram the box wont move. Lets say we applied Force of 100 yet the box remains stationary. At this point Friction Force of 100 is acting on the box preventing the box from moving. If we increase the Force lets say to 150 and the box just about starts to move the Friction Force is 150 N. To be able to move the box we need to push Hardness enough to overcome the Friction and then move the box. If we therefore apply Force of 200 remembering that Friction Force of 150 is present the first 150 will be used to overcome or cancel the Friction and the other 50 will be used to move (accelerate) the block. In order to accelerate an object we must have resultant Force acting on the block. Now what do you think will happen if we pushed harder lets say 300 N? Or what do you think will happen if the Mass of the block was more say 20 Kilogram or what if it was less? Let us investigate how the Motion of an object is affected by Mass and Force You will have noted in the investigation above that the heavier the trolley is the slower it moved. The acceleration is indirectly proportional to the Mass In mathematical terms: In similar investigation where the Mass is kept constant but the applied Force is varied you will find that the bigger the Force is the faster the object will move. The acceleration of the trolley is therefore directly proportional to the resultant Force In mathematical terms: F. If we rearrange the above equations we get OR ma Newton formulated his second law as follows: Definition: Newtons Second Law of Motion If resultant Force acts on body it will cause the body to accelerate in the Direction (geometry) of the resultant Force The acceleration of the body will be directly proportional to the resultant Force and indirectly proportional to the Mass of the body. The mathematical representation is m. Applying Newtons Second Law Newtons Second Law can be applied to variety of situations. We will look at the main types of examples that you need to study. Object on an inclined plane When we place an object on slope the Force of Gravity (Fg) acts straight down and not perpendicular to the slope. Due to Gravity pulling straight down the object will tend to slide down the slope with Force equal to the horizontal component of the Force of Gravity (Fg sin ). The object will stick to the slope due to the Friction Force between the object and the surface. As you increase the angle of the slope the horizontal component will also increase until the Friction Force is overcome and the object starts to slide down the slope. The Force of Gravity will also tend to push an object into the slope. This Force is equal to the vertical component of the Force of Gravity (Fg cos ). There is no movement in this Direction (geometry) as this Force is balanced by the slope pushing up against the object. This ?pushing Force is called the normal Force (N) and is equal to the resultant Force in the vertical Direction (geometry) Fg sin in this case but opposite in Direction (geometry) Important: Do not use the abbreviation for weight as it is used to abbreviate Work (physics) Rather use the Force of Gravity Fg for weight. Lifts and rockets So far we have looked at objects being pulled or pushed across surface in other words hori- zontal Motion Here we only considered horizontal Force but we can also lift objects up or let them fall. This is vertical Motion where only vertical Force are being considered. Let us consider 500 Kilogram lift with no passengers hanging on cable. The purpose of the cable is to pull the lift upwards so that it can reach the next floor or to let go little so that it can move downwards to the floor below. We will look at five possible stages during the Motion of the lift. Stage 1: The 500 Kilogram lift is stationary at the second floor of tall building. Because the lift is stationary (not moving) there is no resultant Force acting on the lift. This means that the upward Force must be balanced by the downward Force The only Force acting down is the Force of Gravity which is equal to (500 98 4900 N) in this case. The cable must therefore pull upwards with Force of 4900 to keep the lift stationary at this point. Stage 2: The lift moves upwards at an acceleration of ms2. If the lift is accelerating it means that there is resultant Force in the Direction (geometry) of the Motion This means that the Force acting upwards is now bigger than the Force of Gravity Fg (down). To find the magnitude of the Force applied by the cable (Fc) we can do the following calculation: (Remember to choose Direction (geometry) as Position (vector) We have chosen upwards as Position (vector) FR ma Fc Fg ma Fc (4900) (500)(1) Fc 5400 upwards The answer makes sense as we need bigger Force upwards to cancel the effect of Gravity as well as make the lift go faster. Stage 3: The lift moves at constant Velocity When the lift moves at constant Velocity it means that all the Force are balanced and that there is no resultant Force The acceleration is zero therefore FR 0. The Force acting upwards is equal to the Force acting downwards therefore Fc 4900 N. Stage 4: The lift slow down at rate of 2ms2. As the lift is now slowing down there is resultant Force downwards. This means that the Force acting downwards is bigger than the Force acting upwards. To find the magnitude of the Force applied by the cable (Fc) we can do the following calculation: Again we have chosen upwards as Position (vector) which means that the acceleration will be negative number. This makes sense as we need smaller Force upwards to ensure resultant Force down. The Force of Gravity is now bigger than the upward pull of the cable and the lift will slow down. Stage 5: The cable snaps. When the cable snaps the Force that used to be acting upwards is no longer present. The only Force that is present would be the Force of Gravity The lift will Free fall and its acceleration can be calculated as follows: Rockets Like with lifts rockets are also examples of objects in vertical Motion The Force of Gravity pulls the rocket down while the thrust of the engine pushes the rocket upwards. The Force that the engine exerts must overcome the Force of Gravity so that the rocket can accelerate upwards. The Work (physics) example below looks at the application of Newtons Second Law in launching rocket. ,According to Newton things like to keep on doing what they are doing. In other words if an object is moving it likes to keep on moving and if an object is stationary it likes to stay stationary. So how do objects start to move then? Let us look at the example of 10 <b>Kilogram</b> box on rough table. If we push lightly on the box as indicated in the diagram the box wont move. Lets say we applied <b>Force</b> of 100 yet the box remains stationary. At this point <b>Friction</b> <b>Force</b> of 100 is acting on the box preventing the box from moving. If we increase the <b>Force</b> lets say to 150 and the box just about starts to move the <b>Friction</b> <b>Force</b> is 150 N. To be able to move the box we need to push <b>Hardness</b> enough to overcome the <b>Friction</b> and then move the box. If we therefore apply <b>Force</b> of 200 remembering that <b>Friction</b> <b>Force</b> of 150 is present the first 150 will be used to overcome or cancel the <b>Friction</b> and the other 50 will be used to move (accelerate) the block. In order to accelerate an object we must have resultant <b>Force</b> acting on the block. Now what do you think will happen if we pushed harder lets say 300 N? Or what do you think will happen if the <b>Mass</b> of the block was more say 20 <b>Kilogram</b> or what if it was less? Let us investigate how the <b>Motion</b> of an object is affected by <b>Mass</b> and <b>Force</b> You will have noted in the investigation above that the heavier the trolley is the slower it moved. The acceleration is indirectly proportional to the <b>Mass</b> In mathematical terms: In similar investigation where the <b>Mass</b> is kept constant but the applied <b>Force</b> is varied you will find that the bigger the <b>Force</b> is the faster the object will move. The acceleration of the trolley is therefore directly proportional to the resultant <b>Force</b> In mathematical terms: F. If we rearrange the above equations we get OR ma Newton formulated his second law as follows: Definition: Newtons Second Law of <b>Motion</b> If resultant <b>Force</b> acts on body it will cause the body to accelerate in the <b>Direction (geometry)</b> of the resultant <b>Force</b> The acceleration of the body will be directly proportional to the resultant <b>Force</b> and indirectly proportional to the <b>Mass</b> of the body. The mathematical representation is m. Applying Newtons Second Law Newtons Second Law can be applied to variety of situations. We will look at the main types of examples that you need to study. Object on an inclined plane When we place an object on slope the <b>Force</b> of <b>Gravity</b> (Fg) acts straight down and not perpendicular to the slope. Due to <b>Gravity</b> pulling straight down the object will tend to slide down the slope with <b>Force</b> equal to the horizontal component of the <b>Force</b> of <b>Gravity</b> (Fg sin ). The object will stick to the slope due to the <b>Friction</b> <b>Force</b> between the object and the surface. As you increase the angle of the slope the horizontal component will also increase until the <b>Friction</b> <b>Force</b> is overcome and the object starts to slide down the slope. The <b>Force</b> of <b>Gravity</b> will also tend to push an object into the slope. This <b>Force</b> is equal to the vertical component of the <b>Force</b> of <b>Gravity</b> (Fg cos ). There is no movement in this <b>Direction (geometry)</b> as this <b>Force</b> is balanced by the slope pushing up against the object. This ?pushing <b>Force</b> is called the normal <b>Force</b> (N) and is equal to the resultant <b>Force</b> in the vertical <b>Direction (geometry)</b> Fg sin in this case but opposite in <b>Direction (geometry)</b> Important: Do not use the abbreviation for weight as it is used to abbreviate <b>Work (physics)</b> Rather use the <b>Force</b> of <b>Gravity</b> Fg for weight. Lifts and rockets So far we have looked at objects being pulled or pushed across surface in other words hori- zontal <b>Motion</b> Here we only considered horizontal <b>Force</b> but we can also lift objects up or let them fall. This is vertical <b>Motion</b> where only vertical <b>Force</b> are being considered. Let us consider 500 <b>Kilogram</b> lift with no passengers hanging on cable. The purpose of the cable is to pull the lift upwards so that it can reach the next floor or to let go little so that it can move downwards to the floor below. We will look at five possible stages during the <b>Motion</b> of the lift. Stage 1: The 500 <b>Kilogram</b> lift is stationary at the second floor of tall building.

The cable must therefore pull upwards with <b>Force</b> of 4900 to keep the lift stationary at this point. Stage 2: The lift moves upwards at an acceleration of ms2. If the lift is accelerating it means that there is resultant <b>Force</b> in the <b>Direction (geometry)</b> of the <b>Motion</b> This means that the <b>Force</b> acting upwards is now bigger than the <b>Force</b> of <b>Gravity</b> Fg (down). To find the magnitude of the <b>Force</b> applied by the cable (Fc) we can do the following calculation: (Remember to choose <b>Direction (geometry)</b> as <b>Position (vector)</b> We have chosen upwards as <b>Position (vector)</b> FR ma Fc Fg ma Fc (4900) (500)(1) Fc 5400 upwards The answer makes sense as we need bigger <b>Force</b> upwards to cancel the effect of <b>Gravity</b> as well as make the lift go faster. Stage 3: The lift moves at constant <b>Velocity</b> When the lift moves at constant <b>Velocity</b> it means that all the <b>Force</b> are balanced and that there is no resultant <b>Force</b> The acceleration is zero therefore FR 0. The <b>Force</b> acting upwards is equal to the <b>Force</b> acting downwards therefore Fc 4900 N. Stage 4: The lift slow down at rate of 2ms2. As the lift is now slowing down there is resultant <b>Force</b> downwards. This means that the <b>Force</b> acting downwards is bigger than the <b>Force</b> acting upwards.

The <b>Force</b> of <b>Gravity</b> is now bigger than the upward pull of the cable and the lift will slow down. Stage 5: The cable snaps. When the cable snaps the <b>Force</b> that used to be acting upwards is no longer present. The only <b>Force</b> that is present would be the <b>Force</b> of <b>Gravity</b> The lift will <b>Free fall</b> and its acceleration can be calculated as follows: Rockets Like with lifts rockets are also examples of objects in vertical <b>Motion</b> The <b>Force</b> of <b>Gravity</b> pulls the rocket down while the thrust of the engine pushes the rocket upwards. The <b>Force</b> that the engine exerts must overcome the <b>Force</b> of <b>Gravity</b> so that the rocket can accelerate upwards.

178,178,12.3.4,Newton's Third Law of Motion,263,Newtons Third Law of Motion deals with the interaction between pairs of objects. For example if you hold book up against wall you are exerting force on the book (to keep it there) and the book is exerting force back at you (to keep you from falling through the book). This may sound strange but if the book was not pushing back at you your hand will push through the book These two forces (the force of the hand on the book (F1) and the force of the book on the hand (F2)) are called an action-reaction pair of forces. They have the same magnitude but act in opposite directions and act on different objects (the one force is onto the book and the other is onto your hand). There is another action-reaction pair of forces present in this situation. The book is pushing against the wall (action force) and the wall is pushing back at the book (reaction). The force of the book on the wall (F3) and the force of the wall on the book (F4) are shown in the diagram. Definition: Newtons Third Law of Motion If body exerts force on body then body exerts force of equal magnitude on body but in the opposite direction.

179,179,12.3.6,Different types of forces,268,Tension Tension is the magnitude of the force that exists in objects like ropes chains and struts that are providing support. For example there are tension forces in the ropes supporting childs swing hanging from tree. Contact and non-contact forces In this chapter we have come across number of different types of forces for example push or pull tension in string frictional forces and the normal. These are all examples of contact forces where there is physical point of contact between applying the force and the object. Non-contact forces are forces that act over distance for example magnetic forces electrostatic forces and gravitational forces. When an object is placed on surface two types of surface forces can be identified. Fric- tion is force that acts between the surface and the object and parallel to the surface. The normal force is force that acts between the object and the surface and parallel to the surface. The normal force kg box is placed on rough surface and 10 force is applied at an angle of 369 to the horizontal. The box does not move. The normal force (N or FN) is the force between the box and the surface acting in the vertical direction. If this force is not present the box would fall through the surface because the force of gravity pulls it downwards. The normal force therefore acts upwards. We can calculate the normal force by considering all the forces in the vertical direction. All the forces in the vertical direction must add up to zero because there is no movement in the vertical direction. The most interesting and illustrative normal force question that is often asked has to do with scale in lift. Using Newtons third law we can solve these problems quite easily. When you stand on scale to measure your weight you are pulled down by gravity. There is no acceleration downwards because there is reaction force we call the normal force acting upwards on you. This is the force that the scale would measure. If the gravitational force were less then the reading on the scale would be less. Now we are going to add things to exactly the same problem to show how things change slightly. We will now move to lift moving at constant velocity. Remember if velocity is constant then acceleration is zero. In the previous two examples we got exactly the same result because the net acceleration on the man was zero If the lift is accelerating downwards things are slightly different and now we will get more interesting answer Friction forces When the surface of one object slides over the surface of another each body exerts frictional force on the other. For example if book slides across table the table exerts frictional force onto the book and the book exerts frictional force onto the table (Newtons Third Law). Frictional forces act parallel to the surfaces. force is not always big enough to make an object move for example small applied force might not be able to move heavy crate. The frictional force opposing the motion of the crate is equal to the applied force but acting in the opposite direction. This frictional force is called static friction. When we increase the applied force (push harder) the frictional force will also increase until the applied force overcomes it. This frictional force can vary from zero (when no other forces are present and the object is stationary) to maximum that depends on the surfaces. When the applied force is greater than the frictional force and the crate will move. The frictional force will now decrease to new constant value which is also dependent on the surfaces. This is called kinetic friction. In both cases the maximum frictional force is related to the normal force and can be calculated as follows: For static friction: Ff Where the coefficient of static friction and normal force For kinetic friction: Ff Where the coefficient of kinetic friction and normal force Remember that static friction is present when the object is not moving and kinetic friction while the object is moving. For example when you drive at constant velocity in car on tar road you have to keep the accelerator pushed in slightly to overcome the kinetic friction between the tar road and the wheels of the car. The higher the value for the coefficient of friction the more sticky the surface is and the lower the value the more slippery the surface is. The frictional force (Ff acts in the horizontal direction and can be calculated in similar way to the normal for as long as there is no movement. If we use the same example as in figure 12.12 and we choose to the right as positive We often think about friction in negative way but very often friction is useful without us realizing it. If there was no friction and you tried to prop ladder up against wall it would simply slide to the ground. Rock climbers use friction to maintain their grip on cliffs. The brakes of cars would be useless if it wasnt for friction ,Tension (physics) Tension (physics) is the magnitude of the Force that exists in objects like ropes chains and struts that are providing support.

180,180,12.3.8,Forces in equilibrium,276,At the beginning of this chapter it was mentioned that resultant forces cause objects to accelerate in straight line. If an object is stationary or moving at constant velocity then either no forces are acting on the object or the forces acting on that object are exactly balanced. In other words for stationary objects or objects moving with constant velocity the resultant force acting on the object is zero. Additionally if there is perpendicular moment of force then the object will rotate. You will learn more about moments of force later in this chapter. Therefore in order for an object not to move or to be in equilibrium the sum of the forces (resultant force) must be zero and the sum of the moments of force must be zero. Definition: Equilibrium An object in equilibrium has both the sum of the forces acting on it and the sum of the moments of the forces equal to zero. If resultant force acts on an object then that object can be brought into equilibrium by applying an additional force that exactly balances this resultant. Such force is called the equilibrant and is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the original resultant force acting on the object. Definition: Equilibrant The equilibrant of any number of forces is the single force required to produce equilibrium and is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the resultant force. In the figure the resultant of F1 and F2 is shown. The equilibrant of F1 and F2 is then the vector opposite in direction to this resultant with the same magnitude (i.e. F3). F1 F2 and F3 are in equilibrium F3 is the equilibrant of F1 and F2 F1 and F2 are kept in equilibrium by F3 As an example of an object in equilibrium consider an object held stationary by two ropes in the arrangement below: Let us draw free body diagram for the object. In the free body diagram the object is drawn as dot and all forces acting on the object are drawn in the correct directions starting from that dot. In this case three forces are acting on the object. Each rope exerts force on the object in the direction of the rope away from the object. These tension forces are represented by T1 and T2. Since the object has mass it is attracted towards the centre of the Earth. This weight is represented in the force diagram as Fg. Since the object is stationary the resultant force acting on the object is zero. In other words the three force vectors drawn tail-to-head form closed triangle: ,At the beginning of this chapter it was mentioned that resultant Force cause objects to accelerate in straight line. If an object is stationary or moving at constant Velocity then either no Force are acting on the object or the Force acting on that object are exactly balanced. In other words for stationary objects or objects moving with constant Velocity the resultant Force acting on the object is zero. Additionally if there is perpendicular moment of Force then the object will rotate. You will learn more about moments of Force later in this chapter. Therefore in order for an object not to move or to be in equilibrium the sum of the Force (resultant Force must be zero and the sum of the moments of Force must be zero. Definition: Equilibrium An object in equilibrium has both the sum of the Force acting on it and the sum of the moments of the Force equal to zero. If resultant Force acts on an object then that object can be brought into equilibrium by applying an additional Force that exactly balances this resultant. Such Force is called the equilibrant and is equal in magnitude but opposite in Direction (geometry) to the original resultant Force acting on the object. Definition: Equilibrant The equilibrant of any number of Force is the single Force required to produce equilibrium and is equal in magnitude but opposite in Direction (geometry) to the resultant Force In the figure the resultant of F1 and F2 is shown. The equilibrant of F1 and F2 is then the Euclidean vector opposite in Direction (geometry) to this resultant with the same magnitude (i.e. F3). F1 F2 and F3 are in equilibrium F3 is the equilibrant of F1 and F2 F1 and F2 are kept in equilibrium by F3 As an example of an object in equilibrium consider an object held stationary by two ropes in the arrangement below: Let us draw Free body diagram for the object. In the Free body diagram the object is drawn as dot and all Force acting on the object are drawn in the correct Direction (geometry) starting from that dot. In this case three Force are acting on the object. Each rope exerts Force on the object in the Direction (geometry) of the rope away from the object. These Tension (physics) Force are represented by T1 and T2. Since the object has Mass it is attracted towards the centre of the Earth. This weight is represented in the Force diagram as Fg. Since the object is stationary the resultant Force acting on the object is zero.

Therefore in order for an object not to move or to be in equilibrium the sum of the <b>Force</b> (resultant <b>Force</b> must be zero and the sum of the moments of <b>Force</b> must be zero. Definition: Equilibrium An object in equilibrium has both the sum of the <b>Force</b> acting on it and the sum of the moments of the <b>Force</b> equal to zero. If resultant <b>Force</b> acts on an object then that object can be brought into equilibrium by applying an additional <b>Force</b> that exactly balances this resultant. Such <b>Force</b> is called the equilibrant and is equal in magnitude but opposite in <b>Direction (geometry)</b> to the original resultant <b>Force</b> acting on the object. Definition: Equilibrant The equilibrant of any number of <b>Force</b> is the single <b>Force</b> required to produce equilibrium and is equal in magnitude but opposite in <b>Direction (geometry)</b> to the resultant <b>Force</b> In the figure the resultant of F1 and F2 is shown. The equilibrant of F1 and F2 is then the <b>Euclidean vector</b> opposite in <b>Direction (geometry)</b> to this resultant with the same magnitude (i.e. F3). F1 F2 and F3 are in equilibrium F3 is the equilibrant of F1 and F2 F1 and F2 are kept in equilibrium by F3 As an example of an object in equilibrium consider an object held stationary by two ropes in the arrangement below: Let us draw <b>Free body diagram</b> for the object. In the <b>Free body diagram</b> the object is drawn as dot and all <b>Force</b> acting on the object are drawn in the correct <b>Direction (geometry)</b> starting from that dot. In this case three <b>Force</b> are acting on the object. Each rope exerts <b>Force</b> on the object in the <b>Direction (geometry)</b> of the rope away from the object. These <b>Tension (physics)</b> <b>Force</b> are represented by T1 and T2. Since the object has <b>Mass</b> it is attracted towards the centre of the Earth. This weight is represented in the <b>Force</b> diagram as Fg. Since the object is stationary the resultant <b>Force</b> acting on the object is zero. In other words the three <b>Force</b> <b>Euclidean vector</b> drawn tail-to-head form closed triangle:
181,181,12.4,Forces between Masses,282,In Chapter ?? you saw that gravitational fields exert forces on masses in the field. field is region of space in which an object experiences force. The strength of field is defined by field strength. For example the gravitational field strength on or near the surface of the Earth has value that is approximately 98 ms2. The force exerted by field of strength on an object of mass is given by: (12.1) This can be re-written in terms of as: This means that can be understood to be measure of force exerted per unit mass. The force defined in Equation 12.1 is known as weight. Objects in gravitational field exert forces on each other without touching. The gravitational force is an example of non-contact force. Gravity is force and therefore must be described by vector so remember magnitude and direction. ,In Chapter ?? you saw that Gravitational field exert Force on Mass in the Field (physics) Field (physics) is region of space in which an object experiences Force The Strength of materials of Field (physics) is defined by Field (physics) Strength of materials For example the Gravitational field Strength of materials on or near the surface of the Earth has value that is approximately 98 ms2.

182,182,12.4.1,Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation,282,Definition: Newtons Law of Universal Gravitation Every point mass attracts every other point mass by force directed along the line connecting the two. This force is proportional to the product of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The magnitude of the attractive gravitational force between the two point masses is given by: where: is the gravitational constant m1 is the mass of the first point mass m2 is the mass of the second point mass and is the distance between the two point masses. Assuming SI units is measured in newtons (N) m1 and m2 in kilograms (kg) in meters (m) and the constant is approximately equal to 6671011N m2 kg2. Remember that this is force of attraction. For example consider man of mass 80 kg standing 10 from woman with mass of 65 kg. As you can see these forces are very small. Now consider the gravitational force between the Earth and the Moon. The mass of the Earth is 5981024 kg the mass of the Moon is 7351022 kg and the Earth and Moon are 038109 apart. The gravitational force between the Earth and Moon is: From this example you can see that the force is very large. These two examples demonstrate that the bigger the masses the greater the force between them. The 1r2 factor tells us that the distance between the two bodies plays role as well. The closer two bodies are the stronger the gravitational force between them is. We feel the gravitational attraction of the Earth most at the surface since that is the closest we can get to it but if we were in outer-space we would barely even know the Earths gravity existed Remember that which means that every object on Earth feels the same gravitational acceleration That means whether you drop pen or book (from the same height) they will both take the same length of time to hit the ground... in fact they will be head to head for the entire fall if you drop them at the same time. We can show this easily by using the two equations above (Equations 12.2 and 12.3). The force between the Earth (which has the mass me) and an object of mass mo is Since it doesnt matter what mo is this tells us that the acceleration on body (due to the Earths gravity) does not depend on the mass of the body. Thus all objects experience the same gravitational acceleration. The force on different bodies will be different but the acceleration will be the same. Due to the fact that this acceleration caused by gravity is the same on all objects we label it differently instead of using we use which we call the gravitational acceleration. ,Definition: Newton's laws of motion of Universal Gravitation Every point Mass attracts every other point Mass by Force Direction (geometry) along the line connecting the two.

184,184,12.5,Momentum and Impulse,287,Momentum is physical quantity which is closely related to forces. Momentum is property which applies to moving objects. Definition: Momentum Momentum is the tendency of an object to continue to move in its direction of travel. Momentum is calculated from the product of the mass and velocity of an object. The momentum (symbol p) of an object of mass moving at velocity is: According to this equation momentum is related to both the mass and velocity of an object. small car travelling at the same velocity as big truck will have smaller momentum than the truck. The smaller the mass the smaller the velocity. car travelling at 120 kmhr1will have bigger momentum than the same car travelling at 60 kmhr1. Momentum is also related to velocity the smaller the velocity the smaller the momentum. Different objects can also have the same momentum for example car travelling slowly can have the same momentum as motor cycle travelling relatively fast. We can easily demonstrate this. Consider car of mass 000 kg with velocity of ms1(about 30 kmhr1). The momentum of the car is therefore Now consider motor cycle of mass 250 kg travelling at 32 ms1 (about 115 kmhr1). The momentum of the motor cycle is: Even though the motor cycle is considerably lighter than the car the fact that the motor cy- cle is travelling much faster than the car means that the momentum of both vehicles is the same. From the calculations above you are able to derive the unit for momentum as kgms1. Momentum is also vector quantity because it is the product of scalar (m) with vector (v). This means that whenever we calculate the momentum of an object we need to include the direction of the momentum. ,Momentum is Physical quantity which is closely related to Force Momentum is property which applies to moving objects.

186,186,12.5.3,Change in Momentum,291,Let us consider tennis ball (mass 01 g) that is dropped at an initial velocity of ms1and bounces back at final velocity of ms1. As the ball approaches the floor it has momentum that we call the momentum before the collision. When it moves away from the floor it has different momentum called the momentum after the collision. The bounce on the floor can be thought of as collision taking place where the floor exerts force on the tennis ball to change its momentum. The momentum before the bounce can be calculated as follows: Because momentum and velocity are vectors we have to choose direction as positive. For this example we choose the initial direction of motion as positive in other words downwards is When the tennis ball bounces back it changes direction. The final velocity will thus have negative value. The momentum after the bounce can be calculated as follows: pafter vf Now let us look at what happens to the momentum of the tennis ball. The momentum changes during this bounce. We can calculate the change in momentum as follows: Again we have to choose direction as positive and we will stick to our initial choice as down- wards is positive. This means that the final momentum will have negative number. You will notice that this number is bigger than the previous momenta calculated. This is should be the case as the ball needed to be stopped and then given momentum to bounce back. ,Let us consider tennis ball Mass 01 g) that is dropped at an initial Velocity of ms1and bounces back at final Velocity of ms1.

187,187,12.5.5,Newton's Second Law revisited,293,You have learned about Newtons Second Law of motion earlier in this chapter. Newtons Second Law describes the relationship between the motion of an object and the net force on the object. We said that the motion of an object and therefore its momentum can only change when resultant force is acting on it. We can therefore say that because net force causes an object to move it also causes its momentum to change. We can now define Newtons Second Law of motion in terms of momentum. Definition: Newtons Second Law of Motion (N2) The net or resultant force acting on an object is equal to the rate of change of momentum. ,You have learned about Newtons Second Law of Motion earlier in this chapter.

188,188,12.5.6,Impulse,294,Impulse is the product of the net force and the time interval for which the force acts. Impulse is defined as: However from Newtons Second Law we know that Impulse is equal to the change in momentum of an object. From this equation we see that for given change in momentum Fnett is fixed. Thus if Fnet is reduced must be in- creased (i.e. smaller resultant force must be applied for longer to bring about the same change in momentum). Alternatively if is reduced (i.e. the resultant force is applied for shorter period) then the resultant force must be increased to bring about the same change in momentum. ,Impulse is the product of the net Force and the time interval for which the Force acts.

189,189,12.5.8,Conservation of Momentum,297,In the absence of an external force acting on system momentum is conserved. Definition: Conservation of Linear Momentum The total linear momentum of an isolated system is constant. An isolated system has no forces acting on it from the outside. This means that in an isolated system the total momentum before collision or explosion is equal to the total momentum after the collision or explosion. Consider simple collision of two billiard balls. The balls are rolling on frictionless surface and the system is isolated. So we can apply conservation of momentum. The first ball has mass m1 and an initial velocity vi1. The second ball has mass m2 and moves towards the first ball with an initial velocity vi2. This situation is shown in Figure 12.14. The total momentum of the system before the collision pi is: After the two balls collide and move away they each have different momentum. If the first ball has final velocity of vf1 and the second ball has final velocity of vf2 then we have the situation shown in Figure 12.15. This system of two balls is isolated since there are no external forces acting on the balls. There- fore by the principle of conservation of linear momentum the total momentum before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision.

190,190,12.5.9,Physics in Action: Impulse,300,very important application of impulse is improving safety and reducing injuries. In many cases an object needs to be brought to rest from certain initial velocity. This means there is certain specified change in momentum. If the time during which the momentum changes can be increased then the force that must be applied will be less and so it will cause less damage. This is the principle behind arrestor beds for trucks airbags and bending your knees when you jump off chair and land on the ground. Air-Bags in Motor Vehicles Air bags are used in motor vehicles because they are able to reduce the effect of the force experienced by person during an accident. Air bags extend the time required to stop the momentum of the driver and passenger. During collision the motion of the driver and passenger carries them towards the windshield which results in large force exerted over short time in order to stop their momentum. If instead of hitting the windshield the driver and passenger hit an air bag then the time of the impact is increased. Increasing the time of the impact results in decrease in the force. Padding as Protection During Sports The same principle explains why wicket keepers in cricket use padded gloves or why there are padded mats in gymnastics. In cricket when the wicket keeper catches the ball the padding is slightly compressible thus reducing the effect of the force on the wicket keepers hands. Similarly if gymnast falls the padding compresses and reduces the effect of the force on the gymnasts body. Arrestor Beds for Trucks An arrestor bed is patch of ground that is softer than the road. Trucks use these when they have to make an emergency stop. When trucks reaches an arrestor bed the time interval over which the momentum is changed is increased. This decreases the force and causes the truck to slow down. Follow-Through in Sports In sports where rackets and bats are used like tennis cricket squash badminton and baseball the hitter is often encouraged to follow-through when striking the ball. High speed films of the collisions between batsrackets and balls have shown that following through increases the time over which the collision between the racketbat and ball occurs. This increase in the time of the collision causes an increase in the velocity change of the ball. This means that hitter can cause the ball to leave the racketbat faster by following through. In these sports returning the ball with higher velocity often increases the chances of success. Crumple Zones in Cars Another safety application of trying to reduce the force experienced is in crumple zones in cars. When two cars have collision two things can happen: 1. the cars bounce off each other or 2. the cars crumple together. Which situation is more dangerous for the occupants of the cars? When cars bounce off each other or rebound there is larger change in momentum and therefore larger impulse. larger impulse means that greater force is experienced by the occupants of the cars. When cars crumple together there is smaller change in momentum and therefore smaller impulse. The smaller impulse means that the occupants of the cars experience smaller force. Car manufacturers use this idea and design crumple zones into cars such that the car has greater chance of crumpling than rebounding in collision. Also when the car crumples the change in the cars momentum happens over longer time. Both these effects result in smaller force on the occupants of the car thereby increasing their chances of survival. ,very important application of impulse is improving safety and reducing injuries. In many cases an object needs to be brought to rest from certain initial Velocity This means there is certain specified change in momentum. If the time during which the momentum changes can be increased then the Force that must be applied will be less and so it will cause less damage. This is the principle behind arrestor beds for trucks airbags and bending your knees when you jump off chair and land on the ground. Air-Bags in Motor Vehicles Air bags are used in motor vehicles because they are able to reduce the effect of the Force experienced by person during an accident. Air bags extend the time required to stop the momentum of the driver and passenger. During collision the Motion of the driver and passenger carries them towards the windshield which results in large Force exerted over short time in order to stop their momentum. If instead of hitting the windshield the driver and passenger hit an air bag then the time of the impact is increased. Increasing the time of the impact results in decrease in the Force Padding as Protection During Sports The same principle explains why wicket keepers in cricket use padded gloves or why there are padded mats in gymnastics. In cricket when the wicket keeper catches the ball the padding is slightly Compression (physics) thus reducing the effect of the Force on the wicket keepers hands. Similarly if gymnast falls the padding Compression (physics) and reduces the effect of the Force on the gymnasts body. Arrestor Beds for Trucks An arrestor bed is patch of ground that is softer than the road. Trucks use these when they have to make an emergency stop. When trucks reaches an arrestor bed the time interval over which the momentum is changed is increased. This decreases the Force and causes the truck to slow down.

191,191,12.6,Torque and Levers,302,,,
192,192,12.6.1,Torque,302,This chapter has dealt with forces and how they lead to motion in straight line. In this section we examine how forces lead to rotational motion. When an object is fixed or supported at one point and force acts on it distance away from the support it tends to make the object turn. The moment of force or torque (symbol read tau) is defined as the product of the distance from the support or pivot (r) and the component of force perpendicular to the object Torque can be seen as rotational force. The unit of torque is Nm and torque is vector quantity. Some examples of where torque arises are shown in Figures 12.17 12.18 and 12.19. This shows that there is less torque when the force is applied closer to the bolt than further away. Important: Loosening bolt If you are trying to loosen (or tighten) bolt apply the force on the spanner further away from the bolt as this results in greater torque to the bolt making it easier to loosen. Important: Any component of force exerted parallel to an object will not cause the object to turn. Only perpendicular components cause turning. Important: Torques The direction of torque is either clockwise or anticlockwise. When torques are added choose one direction as positive and the opposite direction as negative. If equal clockwise and anti- clockwise torques are applied to an object they will cancel out and there will be no net turning effect. ,This chapter has dealt with Force and how they lead to Motion in straight line.

193,193,12.6.2,Mechanical Advantage and Levers,305,We can use our knowlegde about the moments of forces (torque) to determine whether situations are balanced. For example two mass pieces are placed on seesaw as shown in Figure 12.20. The one mass is kg and the other is kg. The masses are placed distance and respectively from the pivot. By looking at the clockwise and anti-clockwise moments we can determine whether the seesaw will pivot (move) or not. If the sum of the clockwise and anti-clockwise moments is zero the seesaw is in equilibrium (i.e. balanced). The resultant moment is zero as the clockwise and anti-clockwise moments of force are in op- posite directions and therefore cancel each other. As we see in Figure 12.20 we can use different distances away from pivot to balance two different forces. This principle is applied to lever to make lifting heavy object much easier. Definition: Lever lever is rigid object that is used with an appropriate fulcrum or pivot point to multiply the mechanical force that can be applied to another object. Archimedes reputedly said: Give me lever long enough and fulcrum on which to place it and shall move the world. The concept of getting out more than the effort is termed mechanical advantage and is one example of the principle of moments. The lever allows to do less effort but for greater distance. For instance to lift certain unit of weight with lever with an effort of half unit we need distance from the fulcrum in the efforts side to be twice the distance of the weights side. It also means that to lift the weight meter we need to push the lever for meter. The amount of work done is always the same and independent of the dimensions of the lever (in an ideal lever). The lever only allows to trade effort for distance. Ideally this means that the mechanical advantage of system is the ratio of the force that performs the work (output or load) to the applied force (input or effort) assuming there is no friction in the system. In reality the mechanical advantage will be less than the ideal value by an amount determined by the amount of friction. For example you want to raise an object of mass 100 kg. If the pivot is placed as shown in Figure 12.22 what is the mechanical advantage of the lever? In order to calculate mechanical advantage we need to determine the load and effort. Important: Effort is the input force and load is the output force. ,We can use our knowlegde about the moments of Force Torque to determine whether situations are balanced. For example two Mass pieces are placed on seesaw as shown in Figure 12.20. The one Mass is Kilogram and the other is Kilogram The Mass are placed Distance and respectively from the pivot.

197,197,13.2,Lenses,327,In this section we will discuss properties of thin lenses. In Grade 10 you learnt about two kinds of mirrors: concave mirrors which were also known as converging mirrors and convex mirrors which were also known as diverging mirrors. Similarly there are two types of lenses: converging and diverging lenses. We have learnt how light travels in different materials and we are now ready to learn how we can control the direction of light rays. We use lenses to control the direction of light. When light enters lens the light rays bend or change direction as shown in Figure 13.1. Definition: Lens lens is any transparent material (e.g. glass) of an appropriate shape that can take parallel rays of incident light and either converge the rays to point or diverge the rays from point. Some lenses will focus light rays to single point. These lenses are called converging or concave lenses. Other lenses spread out the light rays so that it looks like they all come from the same point. These lenses are called diverging or convex lenses. Lenses change the direction of light rays by refraction. They are designed so that the image appears in certain place or as certain size. Lenses are used in eyeglasses cameras microscopes and telescopes. You also have lenses in your eyes Definition: Converging Lenses Converging lenses converge parallel rays of light and are thicker in the middle than at the edges. Definition: Diverging Lenses Diverging lenses diverge parallel rays of light and are thicker at the edges than in the middle. parallel rays of light enter the lens rays are focused at the same point (a) converging lens will focus the rays that enter the lens parallel rays of light enter the lens rays are spread out as if they are coming from the same point (b) diverging lens will spread out the rays that enter the lens Figure 13.1: The behaviour of parallel light rays entering either converging or diverging lens. Examples of converging and diverging lenses are shown in Figure 13.2. converging lenses diverging lenses Figure 13.2: Types of lenses Before we study lenses in detail there are few important terms that must be defined. Figure 13.3 shows important lens properties: The principal axis is the line which runs horizontally straight through the optical centre of the lens. It is also sometimes called the optic axis. The optical centre (O) of convex lens is usually the centre point of the lens. The direction of all light rays which pass through the optical centre remains unchanged. The focus or focal point of the lens is the position on the principal axis where all light rays which run parallel to the principal axis through the lens converge (come together) at point. Since light can pass through the lens either from right to left or left to right there is focal point on each side of the lens (F1 and F2) at the same distance from the optical centre in each direction. (Note: the plural form of the word focus is foci.) The focal length (f) is the distance between the optical centre and the focal point. ,In this section we will discuss properties of thin lenses. In Grade 10 you learnt about two kinds of mirrors: Curved mirror which were also known as converging mirrors and Curved mirror which were also known as diverging mirrors. Similarly there are two types of lenses: converging and diverging lenses. We have learnt how Light travels in different materials and we are now ready to learn how we can control the Direction (geometry) of Light Ray (optics) We use lenses to control the Direction (geometry) of Light When Light enters lens the Light Ray (optics) bend or change Direction (geometry) as shown in Figure 13.1.

Examples of converging and diverging lenses are shown in Figure 13.2. converging lenses diverging lenses Figure 13.2: Types of lenses Before we study lenses in detail there are few important terms that must be defined. Figure 13.3 shows important lens properties: The principal axis is the line which runs horizontally straight through the Geometrical optics centre of the lens. It is also sometimes called the Geometrical optics axis. The Geometrical optics centre (O) of convex lens is usually the centre point of the lens. The Direction (geometry) of all Light Ray (optics) which pass through the Geometrical optics centre remains unchanged. The focus or focal point of the lens is the Position (vector) on the principal axis where all Light Ray (optics) which run parallel to the principal axis through the lens converge (come together) at point.

198,198,13.2.1,Converging Lenses,329,We will only discuss double convex converging lenses as shown in Figure 13.4. Converging lenses are thinner on the outside and thicker on the inside. Figure 13.5 shows convex lens. Light rays traveling through convex lens are bent towards the principal axis. For this reason convex lenses are called converging lenses. Figure 13.5: Light rays bend towards each other or converge when they travel through convex lens. F1 and F2 are the foci of the lens. The type of images created by convex lens is dependent on the position of the object. We will examine the following cases: 1. the object is placed at distance greater than 2f from the lens 2. the object is placed at distance equal to 2f from the lens 3. the object is placed at distance between 2f and from the lens 4. the object is placed at distance less than from the lens We examine the properties of the image in each of these cases by drawing ray diagrams. We can find the image by tracing the path of three light rays through the lens. Any two of these rays will show us the location of the image. You can use the third ray to check the location. Drawing Ray Diagrams for Converging Lenses The three rays are labelled R1 R2 and R3. The ray diagrams that follow will use this naming convention. 1. The first ray (R1) travels from the object to the lens parallel to the principal axis. This ray is bent by the lens and travels through the focal point. 2. Any ray travelling parallel to the principal axis is bent through the focal point. 3. If light ray passes through focal point before it enters the lens then it will leave the lens parallel to the principal axis. The second ray (R2) is therefore drawn to pass through the focal point before it enters the lens. 4. ray that travels through the centre of the lens does not change direction. The third ray (R3) is drawn through the centre of the lens. 5. The point where all three of the rays (R1 R2 and R3) intersect is the image of the point where they all started. The image will form at this point. CASE 1: Object placed at distance greater than 2f from the lens Figure 13.7: An object is placed at distance greater than 2f away from the converging lens. Three rays are drawn to locate the image which is real smaller than the object and inverted. We can locate the position of the image by drawing our three rays. R1 travels from the object to the lens parallel to the principal axis and is bent by the lens and then travels through the focal point. R2 passes through the focal point before it enters the lens and therefore must leave the lens parallel to the principal axis. R3 travels through the center of the lens and does not change direction. The point where R1 R2 and R3 intersect is the image of the point where they all started. The image of an object placed at distance greater than 2f from the lens is upside down or inverted. This is because the rays which began at the top of the object above the principal axis after passing through the lens end up below the principal axis. The image is called real image because it is on the opposite side of the lens to the object and you can trace all the light rays directly from the image back to the object. The image is also smaller than the object and is located closer to the lens than the object. Important: In reality light rays come from all points along the length of the object. In ray diagrams we only draw three rays (all starting at the top of the object) to keep the diagram clear and simple. CASE 2: Object placed at distance equal to 2f from the lens Figure 13.8: An object is placed at distance equal to 2f away from the converging lens. Three rays are drawn to locate the image which is real the same size as the object and inverted. We can locate the position of the image by drawing our three rays. R1 travels from the object to the lens parallel to the principal axis and is bent by the lens and then travels through the focal point. R2 passes through the focal point before it enters the lens and therefore must leave the lens parallel to the principal axis. R3 travels through the center of the lens and does not change direction. The point where R1 R2 and R3 intersect is the image of the point where they all started. The image of an object placed at distance equal to 2f from the lens is upside down or inverted. This is because the rays which began at the top of the object above the principal axis after passing through the lens end up below the principal axis. The image is called real image because it is on the opposite side of the lens to the object and you can trace all the light rays directly from the image back to the object. The image is the same size as the object and is located at distance 2f away from the lens. CASE 3: Object placed at distance between 2f and from the lens Figure 13.9: An object is placed at distance between 2f and away from the converging lens. Three rays are drawn to locate the image which is real larger than the object and inverted. We can locate the position of the image by drawing our three rays. R1 travels from the object to the lens parallel to the principal axis and is bent by the lens and then travels through the focal point. R2 passes through the focal point before it enters the lens and therefore must leave the lens parallel to the principal axis. R3 travels through the center of the lens and does not change direction. The point where R1 R2 and R3 intersect is the image of the point where they all started. The image of an object placed at distance between 2f and from the lens is upside down or inverted. This is because the rays which began at the top of the object above the principal axis after passing through the lens end up below the principal axis. The image is called real image because it is on the opposite side of the lens to the object and you can trace all the light rays directly from the image back to the object. The image is larger than the object and is located at distance greater than 2f away from the lens. CASE 4: Object placed at distance less than from the lens Figure 13.10: An object is placed at distance less than away from the converging lens. Three rays are drawn to locate the image which is virtual larger than the object and upright. We can locate the position of the image by drawing our three rays. R1 travels from the object to the lens parallel to the principal axis and is bent by the lens and then travels through the focal point. R2 passes through the focal point before it enters the lens and therefore must leave the lens parallel to the principal axis. R3 travels through the center of the lens and does not change direction. The point where R1 R2 and R3 intersect is the image of the point where they all started. The image of an object placed at distance less than from the lens is upright. The image is called virtual image because it is on the same side of the lens as the object and you cannot trace all the light rays directly from the image back to the object. The image is larger than the object and is located further away from the lens than the object. Extension: The thin lens equation and magnification The Thin Lens Equation We can find the position of the image of lens mathematically as there is mathematical relation between the object distance image distance and focal length. The equation is: where is the focal length do is the object distance and di is the image distance. The object distance do is the distance from the object to the lens. do is positive if the object is on the same side of the lens as the light rays enter the lens. This should make sense: we expect the light rays to travel from the object to the lens. The image distance di is the distance from the lens to the image. Unlike mirrors which reflect light back lenses refract light through them. We expect to find the image on the same side of the lens as the light leaves the lens. If this is the case then di is positive and the image is real (see Figure 13.9). Sometimes the image will be on the same side of the lens as the light rays enter the lens. Then di is negative and the image is virtual (Figure 13.10). If we know any two of the three quantities above then we can use the Thin Lens Equation to solve for the third quantity. Magnification It is possible to calculate the magnification of an image. The magnification is how much bigger or smaller the image is than the object. where is the magnification do is the object distance and di is the image distance. If di and do are both positive the magnification is negative. This means the image is inverted or upside down. If di is negative and do is positive then the image is not inverted or right side up. If the absolute value of the magnification is greater than one the image is larger than the object. For example magnification of -2 means the image is inverted and twice as big as the object. ,We will only discuss double convex converging lenses as shown in Figure 13.4. Converging lenses are thinner on the outside and thicker on the inside. Figure 13.5 shows convex lens. Light Ray (optics) traveling through convex lens are bent towards the principal axis. For this reason convex lenses are called converging lenses. Figure 13.5: Light Ray (optics) bend towards each other or converge when they travel through convex lens. F1 and F2 are the foci of the lens. The type of images created by convex lens is dependent on the Position (vector) of the object. We will examine the following cases: 1. the object is placed at Distance greater than 2f from the lens 2. the object is placed at Distance equal to 2f from the lens 3. the object is placed at Distance between 2f and from the lens 4. the object is placed at Distance less than from the lens We examine the properties of the image in each of these cases by drawing Ray (optics) diagrams. We can find the image by tracing the path of three Light Ray (optics) through the lens. Any two of these Ray (optics) will show us the location of the image. You can use the third Ray (optics) to check the location. Drawing Ray (optics) Diagrams for Converging Lenses The three Ray (optics) are labelled R1 R2 and R3. The Ray (optics) diagrams that follow will use this naming convention. 1. The first Ray (optics) (R1) travels from the object to the lens parallel to the principal axis. This Ray (optics) is bent by the lens and travels through the focal point. 2. Any Ray (optics) travelling parallel to the principal axis is bent through the focal point. 3. If Light Ray (optics) passes through focal point before it enters the lens then it will leave the lens parallel to the principal axis.

199,199,13.2.2,Diverging Lenses,340,We will only discuss double concave diverging lenses as shown in Figure 13.11. Concave lenses are thicker on the outside and thinner on the inside. Figure 13.12 shows concave lens with light rays travelling through it. You can see that concave lenses have the opposite curvature to convex lenses. This causes light rays passing through concave lens to diverge or be spread out away from the principal axis. For this reason concave lenses are called diverging lenses. Images formed by concave lenses are always virtual. Unlike converging lenses the type of images created by concave lens is not dependent on the position of the object. The image is always upright smaller than the object and located closer to the lens than the object. We examine the properties of the image by drawing ray diagrams. We can find the image by tracing the path of three light rays through the lens. Any two of these rays will show us the location of the image. You can use the third ray to check the location but it is not necessary to show it on your diagram. Figure 13.12: Light rays bend away from each other or diverge when they travel through concave lens. F1 and F2 are the foci of the lens. Drawing Ray Diagrams for Diverging Lenses Draw the three rays starting at the top of the object. 1. Ray R1 travels parallel to the principal axis. The ray bends and lines up with focal point. However the concave lens is diverging lens so the ray must line up with the focal point on the same side of the lens where light rays enter it. This means that we must project an imaginary line backwards through that focal point (F1) (shown by the dashed line extending from R1). 2. Ray R2 points towards the focal point F2 on the opposite side of the lens. When it hits the lens it is bent parallel to the principal axis. 3. Ray R3 passes through the optical center of the lens. Like for the convex lens this ray passes through with its direction unchanged. 4. We find the image by locating the point where the rays meet. Since the rays diverge they will only meet if projected backward to point on the same side of the lens as the object. This is why concave lenses always have virtual images. (Since the light rays do not actually meet at the image the image cannot be real.) Figure 13.13 shows an object placed at an arbitrary distance from the diverging lens. We can locate the position of the image by drawing our three rays for diverging lens. Figure 13.13 shows that the image of an object is upright. The image is called virtual image because it is on the same side of the lens as the object. The image is smaller than the object and is closer to the lens than the object.

Ray (optics) R3 passes through the Geometrical optics center of the lens. Like for the convex lens this Ray (optics) passes through with its Direction (geometry) unchanged. 4. We find the image by locating the point where the Ray (optics) meet. Since the Ray (optics) diverge they will only meet if projected backward to point on the same side of the lens as the object. This is why concave lenses always have Virtual image (Since the Light Ray (optics) do not actually meet at the image the image cannot be real.)

Drawing <b>Ray (optics)</b> Diagrams for Diverging Lenses Draw the three <b>Ray (optics)</b> starting at the top of the object. 1. <b>Ray (optics)</b> R1 travels parallel to the principal axis. The <b>Ray (optics)</b> bends and lines up with focal point. However the concave lens is diverging lens so the <b>Ray (optics)</b> must line up with the focal point on the same side of the lens where <b>Light</b> <b>Ray (optics)</b> enter it. This means that we must project an imaginary line backwards through that focal point (F1) (shown by the dashed line extending from R1). 2. <b>Ray (optics)</b> R2 points towards the focal point F2 on the opposite side of the lens. When it hits the lens it is bent parallel to the principal axis. 3. <b>Ray (optics)</b> R3 passes through the <b>Geometrical optics</b> center of the lens. Like for the convex lens this <b>Ray (optics)</b> passes through with its <b>Direction (geometry)</b> unchanged. 4. We find the image by locating the point where the <b>Ray (optics)</b> meet. Since the <b>Ray (optics)</b> diverge they will only meet if projected backward to point on the same side of the lens as the object. This is why concave lenses always have <b>Virtual image</b> (Since the <b>Light</b> <b>Ray (optics)</b> do not actually meet at the image the image cannot be real.) Figure 13.13 shows an object placed at an arbitrary <b>Distance</b> from the diverging lens. We can locate the <b>Position (vector)</b> of the image by drawing our three <b>Ray (optics)</b> for diverging lens. Figure 13.13 shows that the image of an object is upright. The image is called <b>Virtual image</b> because it is on the same side of the lens as the object. The image is smaller than the object and is closer to the lens than the object. Figure 13.13: Three <b>Ray (optics)</b> are drawn to locate the image which is virtual smaller than the object and upright.
200,200,13.3,The Human Eye,344,,,
201,201,13.3.1,Structure of the Eye,345,Eyesight begins with lenses. As light rays enter your eye they pass first through the cornea and then through the crystalline lens. These form double lens system and focus light rays onto the back wall of the eye called the retina. Rods and cones are nerve cells on the retina that transform light into electrical signals. These signals are sent to the brain via the optic nerve. cross-section of the eye is shown in Figure 13.14. For clear vision the image must be formed right on the retina not in front of or behind it. To accomplish this you may need long or short focal length depending on the object distance. How do we get the exact right focal length we need? Remember that the lens system has two parts. The cornea is fixed in place but the crystalline lens is flexible it can change shape. When the shape of the lens changes its focal length also changes. You have muscles in your eye called ciliary muscles that control the shape of the crystalline lens. When you focus your gaze on something you are squeezing (or relaxing) these muscles. This process of accommodation changes the focal length of the lens and allows you to see an image clearly. The lens in the eye creates real image that is smaller than the object and is inverted ,Eyesight begins with lenses.

202,202,13.3.2,Defects of Vision,346,In normal eye the image is focused on the retina. If the muscles in the eye are unable to accommodate adequately the image will not be in focus. This leads to problems with vision. There are three basic conditions that arise: 1. short-sightedness 2. long-sightedness 3. astigmatism Short-sightedness Short-sightedness or myopia is defect of vision which means that the image is focused in front of the retina. Close objects are seen clearly but distant objects appear blurry. This condition can be corrected by placing diverging lens in front of the eye. The diverging lens spreads out light rays before they enter the eye. The situation for short-sightedness and how to correct it is shown in Figure 13.17. Long-sightedness Long-sightedness or hyperopia is defect of vision which means that the image is focused in behind the retina. People with this condition can see distant objects clearly but not close ones. converging lens in front of the eye corrects long-sightedness by converging the light rays slightly before they enter the eye. Reading glasses are an example of converging lens used to correct long-sightedness. Astigmatism Astigmatism is characterised by cornea or lens that is not spherical but is more curved in one plane compared to another. This means that horizontal lines may be focused at different point to vertical lines. Astigmatism is corrected by special lens which has different focal lengths in the vertical and horizontal planes. ,In normal eye the image is focused on the retina.

When we studied transverse waves we looked at two different motions: the motion of the particles of the medium and the motion of the save itself. We will do the same for longitudinal waves. The question is how do we construct such wave? To create transverse wave we flick the end of for example rope up and down. The particles move up and down and return to their equilibrium position. The wave moves from left to right and will be displaced. longitudinal wave is seen best in spring that is hung from ceiling. Do the following investigation to find out more about longitudinal waves. From the investigation you will have noticed that the disturbance moves in the same direction as the direction in which the spring was pulled. The spring was pulled up and down and the wave also moved up and down. The ribbon in the investigation represents one particle in the medium.

217,217,14.4,"Graphs of Particle Position, Displacement, Velocity and Acceleration",359,When longitudinal wave moves through the medium the particles in the medium only move back and forth relative to the direction of motion of the wave. We can see this in Figure 14.4 which shows the motion of the particles in medium as longitudinal wave moves through the medium.

218,218,14.5,Sound Waves,360,Sound waves coming from tuning fork cause the tuning fork to vibrate and push against the air particles in front of it. As the air particles are pushed together compression is formed. The particles behind the compression move further apart causing rarefaction. As the particles continue to push against each other the sound wave travels through the air. Due to this motion of the particles there is constant variation in the pressure in the air. Sound waves are therefore pressure waves. This means that in media where the particles are closer together sound waves will travel quicker. Sound waves travel faster through liquids like water than through the air because water is denser than air (the particles are closer together). Sound waves travel faster in solids than in liquids. Figure 14.8: Sound waves are pressure waves and need medium through which to travel. Important: sound wave is different from light wave. sound wave is produced by an oscillating object while light wave is not. sound wave cannot be diffracted while light wave can be diffracted. Also because sound wave is mechanical wave (i.e. that it needs medium) it is not capable of traveling through vacuum whereas light wave can travel through vacuum. Important: sound wave is pressure wave. This means that regions of high pressure (compressions) and low pressure (rarefactions) are created as the sound source vibrates. These compressions and rarefactions arise because sound vibrates longitudinally and the longitudinal motion of air produces pressure fluctuations. Sound will be studied in more detail in Chapter 15. ,Sound Wave coming from tuning fork cause the tuning fork to vibrate and push against the air particles in front of it.

Seismic waves also occur on other planets for example the moon and can be natural (due to earthquakes volcanic eruptions or meteor strikes) or man-made (due to explosions or anything that hits the earth hard). Seismic P-waves (P for pressure) are longitudinal waves which can travel through solid and liquid. ,Seismic Wave are Wave from vibrations in the Earth (core mantle oceans).

222,222,15.2,Characteristics of a Sound Wave,363,Since sound is wave we can relate the properties of sound to the properties of wave. The basic properties of sound are: pitch loudness and tone. Figure 15.1: Pitch and loudness of sound. Sound has lower pitch (lower frequency) than Sound and is softer (smaller amplitude) than Sound C. ,Since Sound is Wave we can relate the properties of Sound to the properties of Wave The basic properties of Sound are: Pitch (music) loudness and Musical tone Figure 15.1: Pitch (music) and loudness of Sound Sound has lower Pitch (music) (lower Frequency than Sound and is softer (smaller Amplitude than Sound C. ,Since <b>Sound</b> is <b>Wave</b> we can relate the properties of <b>Sound</b> to the properties of <b>Wave</b> The basic properties of <b>Sound</b> are: <b>Pitch (music)</b> loudness and <b>Musical tone</b> Figure 15.1: <b>Pitch (music)</b> and loudness of <b>Sound</b> <b>Sound</b> has lower <b>Pitch (music)</b> (lower <b>Frequency</b> than <b>Sound</b> and is softer (smaller <b>Amplitude</b> than <b>Sound</b> C.
223,223,15.2.1,Pitch,364,The frequency of sound wave is what your ear understands as pitch. higher frequency sound has higher pitch and lower frequency sound has lower pitch. In Figure 15.1 sound has higher pitch than sound B. For instance the chirp of bird would have high pitch but the roar of lion would have low pitch. The human ear can detect wide range of frequencies. Frequencies from 20 to 20 000 Hz are audible to the human ear. Any sound with frequency below 20 Hz is known as an infrasound and any sound with frequency above 20 000 Hz is known as an ultrasound. Table 15.1 lists the ranges of some common animals compared to humans. ,The Frequency of Sound Wave is what your ear understands as Pitch (music) higher Frequency Sound has higher Pitch (music) and lower Frequency Sound has lower Pitch (music) In Figure 15.1 Sound has higher Pitch (music) than Sound B.

224,224,15.2.2,Loudness,364,The amplitude of sound wave determines its loudness or volume. larger amplitude means louder sound and smaller amplitude means softer sound. In Figure 15.1 sound is louder than sound B. The vibration of source sets the amplitude of wave. It transmits energy into the medium through its vibration. More energetic vibration corresponds to larger amplitude. The molecules move back and forth more vigorously. The loudness of sound is also determined by the sensitivity of the ear. The human ear is more sensitive to some frequencies than to others. Loudness thus depends on both the amplitude of sound wave and its frequency whether it lies in region where the ear is more or less sensitive. ,The Amplitude of Sound Wave determines its loudness or volume. larger Amplitude means louder Sound and smaller Amplitude means softer Sound In Figure 15.1 Sound is louder than Sound B.

225,225,15.2.3,Tone,364,Tone is measure of the quality of the sound wave. For example the quality of the sound produced in particular musical instruments depends on which harmonics are superposed and in which proportions. The harmonics are determined by the standing waves that are produced in the instrument. Chapter 16 will explain the physics of music in greater detail. The quality (timbre) of the sound heard depends on the pattern of the incoming vibrations i.e. the shape of the sound wave. The more irregular the vibrations the more jagged is the shape of the sound wave and the harsher is the sound heard. ,Musical tone is measure of the quality of the Sound Wave For example the quality of the Sound produced in particular musical instruments depends on which harmonics are superposed and in which proportions.

226,226,15.3,Speed of Sound,365,The speed of sound depends on the medium the sound is travelling in. Sound travels faster in solids than in liquids and faster in liquids than in gases. This is because the density of solids is higher than that of liquids which means that the particles are closer together. Sound can be transmitted more easily. The speed of sound also depends on the temperature of the medium. The hotter the medium is the faster its particles move and therefore the quicker the sound will travel through the medium. When we heat substance the particles in that substance have more kinetic energy and vibrate or move faster. Sound can therefore be transmitted more easily and quickly in hotter substances. Sound waves are pressure waves. The speed of sound will therefore be influenced by the pressure of the medium through which it is travelling. At sea level the air pressure is higher than high up on mountain. Sound will travel faster at sea level where the air pressure is higher than it would at places high above sea level. Definition: Speed of sound The speed of sound in air at sea level at temperature of 21C and under normal atmo- spheric conditions is 344 ms1. ,The Speed of Sound depends on the medium the Sound is travelling in.

227,227,15.4,Physics of the Ear and Hearing,365,The human ear is divided into three main sections: the outer middle and inner ear. Lets follow the journey of sound wave from the pinna to the auditory nerve which transmits signal to the brain. The pinna is the part of the ear we typically think of when we refer to the ear. Its main function is to collect and focus an incident sound wave. The wave then travels through the ear canal until it meets the eardrum. The pressure fluctuations of the sound wave make the eardrum vibrate. The three very small bones of the middle ear the malleus (hammer) the incus (anvil) and the stapes (stirrup) transmit the signal through to the elliptical window. The elliptical window is the beginning of the inner ear. From the elliptical window the sound waves are transmitted through the liquid in the inner ear and interpreted as sounds by the brain. The inner ear made of the semicircular canals the cochlea and the auditory nerve is filled with fluid. The fluid allows the body to detect quick movements and maintain balance. The snail-shaped cochlea is covered in nerve cells. There are more than 25 000 hairlike nerve cells. Different nerve cells vibrate with different frequencies. When nerve cell vibrates it releases electrical impulses to the auditory nerve. The impulses are sent to the brain through the auditory nerve and understood as sound. ,The human ear is divided into three main sections: the outer middle and inner ear.

228,228,15.4.1,Intensity of Sound,366,Intensity is one indicator of amplitude. Intensity is the energy transmitted over unit of area each second. Extension: Intensity Intensity is defined as: Intensity energy time area power area By the definition of intensity we can see that the units of intensity are Joules m2 Watts m2 The unit of intensity is the decibel (symbol: dB). This reduces to an SI equivalent of m2. The threshold of hearing is 1012 m2. Below this intensity the sound is too soft for the ear to hear. The threshold of pain is 1.0 m2. Above this intensity sound is so loud it becomes uncomfortable for the ear. Notice that there is factor of 1012 between the thresholds of hearing and pain. This is one reason we define the decibel (dB) scale. Extension: dB Scale The intensity in dB of sound of intensity is given by: 10 log Io Io 1012 m2 (15.1) In this way we can compress the whole hearing intensity scale into range from dB to 120 dB. Notice that there are sounds which exceed the threshold of pain. Exposure to these sounds can cause immediate damage to hearing. In fact exposure to sounds from 80 dB and above can damage hearing over time. Measures can be taken to avoid damage such as wearing earplugs or ear muffs. Limiting exposure time and increasing distance between you and the source are also important steps to protecting your hearing. ,Intensity is one indicator of Amplitude Intensity is the Energy transmitted over unit of area each second.

229,229,15.5,Ultrasound,367,Ultrasound is sound with frequency that is higher than 20 kHz. Some animals such as dogs dolphins and bats have an upper limit that is greater than that of the human ear and can hear ultrasound. The most common use of ultrasound is to create images and has industrial and medical applications. The use of ultrasound to create images is based on the reflection and transmission of wave at boundary. When an ultrasound wave travels inside an object that is made up of different materials such as the human body each time it encounters boundary e.g. between bone and muscle or muscle and fat part of the wave is reflected and part of it is transmitted. The reflected rays are detected and used to construct an image of the object. Ultrasound in medicine can visualise muscle and soft tissue making them useful for scanning the organs and is commonly used during pregnancy. Ultrasound is safe non-invasive method of looking inside the human body. Ultrasound sources may be used to generate local heating in biological tissue with applications in physical therapy and cancer treatment. Focussed ultrasound sources may be used to break up kidney stones. Ultrasonic cleaners sometimes called supersonic cleaners are used at frequencies from 20-40 kHz for jewellery lenses and other optical parts watches dental instruments surgical instruments and industrial parts. These cleaners consist of containers with fluid in which the object to be cleaned is placed. Ultrasonic waves are then sent into the fluid. The main mechanism for cleaning action in an ultrasonic cleaner is actually the energy released from the collapse of millions of microscopic bubbles occurring in the liquid of the cleaner. Ultrasound generatorspeaker systems are sold with claims that they frighten away rodents and insects but there is no scientific evidence that the devices work controlled tests have shown that rodents quickly learn that the speakers are harmless. In echo-sounding the reflections from ultrasound pulses that are bounced off objects (for example the bottom of the sea fish etc.) are picked up. The reflections are timed and since their speed is known the distance to the object can be found. This information can be built into picture of the object that reflects the ultrasound pulses. ,Ultrasound is Sound with Frequency that is higher than 20 kHz.

Some animals such as dogs dolphins and bats have an upper limit that is greater than that of the human ear and can hear ultrasound. The most common use of ultrasound is to create images and has industrial and medical applications. The use of ultrasound to create images is based on the <b>Reflection (physics)</b> and transmission of <b>Wave</b> at boundary. When an ultrasound <b>Wave</b> travels inside an object that is made up of different materials such as the human body each time it encounters boundary e.g. between bone and muscle or muscle and fat part of the <b>Wave</b> is <b>Reflection (physics)</b> and part of it is transmitted. The <b>Reflection (physics)</b> <b>Ray (optics)</b> are detected and used to construct an image of the object. Ultrasound in medicine can visualise muscle and soft tissue making them useful for scanning the organs and is commonly used during pregnancy. Ultrasound is safe non-invasive method of looking inside the human body. Ultrasound sources may be used to generate local heating in biological tissue with applications in <b>Physics</b> therapy and cancer treatment. Focussed ultrasound sources may be used to break up kidney stones.

233,233,16.1,Introduction,373,What is your favorite musical instrument? How do you play it? Do you pluck string like guitar? Do you blow through it like flute? Do you hit it like drum? All of these work by making standing waves. Each instrument has unique sound because of the special waves made in it. These waves could be in the strings of guitar or violin. They could also be in the skin of drum or tube of air in trumpet. These waves are picked up by the air and later reach your ear as sound. In Grade 10 you learned about standing waves and boundary conditions. We saw rope that was: fixed at both ends fixed at one end and free at the other We also saw pipe: closed at both ends open at both ends open at one end closed at the other String and wind instruments are good examples of standing waves on strings and pipes. One way to describe standing waves is to count nodes. Recall that node is point on string that does not move as the wave changes. The anti-nodes are the highest and lowest points on the wave. There is node at each end of fixed string. There is also node at the closed end of pipe. But an open end of pipe has an anti-node. What causes standing wave? There are incident and reflected waves traveling back and forth on our string or pipe. For some frequencies these waves combine in just the right way so that the whole wave appears to be standing still. These special cases are called harmonic frequencies or harmonics. They depend on the length and material of the medium. Definition: Harmonic harmonic frequency is frequency at which standing waves can be made. ,What is your favorite musical instrument?

234,234,16.2,Standing Waves in String Instruments,373,Let us look at basic instrument: string pulled tight and fixed at both ends. When you pluck the string you hear certain pitch. This pitch is made by certain frequency. What causes the string to emit sounds at this pitch? You have learned that the frequency of standing wave depends on the length of the wave. The wavelength depends on the nodes and anti-nodes. The longest wave that can fit on the string is shown in Figure 16.1. This is called the fundamental or natural frequency of the string. The string has nodes at both ends. The wavelength of the fundamental is twice the length of the string. Now put your finger on the center of the string. Hold it down gently and pluck it. The standing wave now has node in the middle of the string. There are three nodes. We can fit whole wave between the ends of the string. This means the wavelength is equal to the length of the string. This wave is called the first harmonic. As we add more nodes we find the second harmonic third harmonic and so on. We must keep the nodes equally spaced or we will lose our standing wave. You should have found this formula: 2L Here is the number of nodes. is the length of the string. The frequency is: Here is the velocity of the wave. This may seem confusing. The wave is standing wave so how can it have velocity? But one standing wave is made up of many waves that travel back and forth on the string. Each of these waves has the same velocity. This speed depends on the mass and tension of the string. Extension: Guitar Guitars use strings with high tension. The length tension and mass of the strings affect the pitches you hear. High tension and short strings make high frequencies Low tension and long strings make low frequencies. When string is first plucked it vibrates at many frequencies. All of these except the harmonics are quickly filtered out. The harmonics make up the tone we hear. The body of guitar acts as large wooden soundboard. Here is how soundboard works: the body picks up the vibrations of the strings. It then passes these vibrations to the air. sound hole allows the soundboard of the guitar to vibrate more freely. It also helps sound waves to get out of the body. The neck of the guitar has thin metal bumps on it called frets. Pressing string against fret shortens the length of that string. This raises the natural frequency and the pitch of that string. Most guitars use an equal tempered tuning of 12 notes per octave. string guitar has range of octaves with pitches from 82.407 Hz (low E) to 2093 kHz (high C). Harmonics may reach over 20 kHz in the inaudible range. Extension: Piano Let us look at another stringed instrument: the piano. The piano has strings that you can not see. When key is pressed felt-tipped hammer hits string inside the piano. The pitch depends on the length tension and mass of the string. But there are many more strings than keys on piano. This is because the short and thin strings are not as loud as the long and heavy strings. To make up for this the higher keys have groups of two to four strings each. The soundboard in piano is large cast iron plate. It picks up vibrations from the strings. This heavy plate can withstand over 200 tons of pressure from string tension Its mass also allows the piano to sustain notes for long periods of time. The piano has wide frequency range from 275 Hz (low A) to 41860 Hz (upper C). But these are just the fundamental frequencies. piano plays complex rich tones with over 20 harmonics per note. Some of these are out of the range of human hearing. Very low piano notes can be heard mostly because of their higher harmonics. ,Let us look at basic instrument: string pulled tight and fixed at both ends.

235,235,16.3,Standing Waves in Wind Instruments,377,wind instrument is an instrument that is usually made with pipe or thin tube. Examples of wind instruments are recorders clarinets flutes organs etc. When one plays wind instrument the air that is pushed through the pipe vibrates and standing waves are formed. Just like with strings the wavelengths of the standing waves will depend on the length of the pipe and whether it is open or closed at each end. Lets consider each of the following situations: pipe with both ends open like flute or organ pipe. pipe with one end open and one closed like clarinet. If you blow across small hole in pipe or reed it makes sound. If both ends are open standing waves will form according to figure 16.2. You will notice that there is an anti-node at each end. In the next activity you will find how this affects the wavelengths. The formula is different because there are more anti-nodes than nodes. The right formula is: Here is still the number of nodes. long wavelength has low frequency and low pitch. If you took your pipe from the last example and covered one end you should hear much lower note Also the wavelengths of the harmonics for this tube are not integer multiples of each other. Extension: Musical Scale The 12 tone scale popular in Western music took centuries to develop. This scale is also called the 12-note Equal Tempered scale. It has an octave divided into 12 steps. (An octave is the main interval of most scales. If you double frequency you have raised the note one octave.) All steps have equal ratios of frequencies. But this scale is not perfect. If the octaves are in tune all the other intervals are slightly mistuned. No interval is badly out of tune. But none is perfect. For example suppose the base note of scale is frequency of 110 Hz low A). The first harmonic is 220 Hz. This note is also an but is one octave higher. The second harmonic is at 330 Hz (close to an E). The third is 440 Hz (also an A). But not all the notes have such simple ratios. Middle has frequency of about 262 Hz. This is not simple multiple of 110 Hz. So the interval between and is little out of tune. Many other types of tuning exist. Just Tempered scales are tuned so that all intervals are simple ratios of frequencies. There are also equal tempered scales with more or less notes per octave. Some scales use as many as 31 or 53 notes. ,wind instrument is an instrument that is usually made with pipe or thin tube.

236,236,16.4,Resonance,382,Resonance is the tendency of system to vibrate at maximum amplitude at the natural frequency of the system. Resonance takes place when system is made to vibrate at its natural frequency as result of vibrations that are received from another source of the same frequency. In the following investigation you will measure the speed of sound using resonance.

237,237,16.5,Music and Sound Quality,384,In the sound chapter we referred to the quality of sound as its tone. What makes the tone of note played on an instrument? When you pluck string or vibrate air in tube you hear mostly the fundamental frequency. Higher harmonics are present but are fainter. These are called overtones. The tone of note depends on its mixture of overtones. Different instruments have different mixtures of overtones. This is why the same note sounds different on flute and piano. Let us see how overtones can change the shape of wave: The resultant waveform is very different from the fundamental frequency.

240,240,17.2,Forces between charges - Coulomb's Law,387,Like charges repel each other while opposite charges attract each other. If the charges are at rest then the force between them is known as the electrostatic force. The electrostatic force between charges increases when the magnitude of the charges increases or the distance between the charges decreases. The electrostatic force was first studied in detail by Charles Coulomb around 1784. Through his observations he was able to show that the electrostatic force between two point-like charges is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the objects. He also discovered that the force is proportional to the product of the charges on the two objects. Q1Q2 r2 where Q1 is the charge on the one point-like object Q2 is the charge on the second and is the distance between the two. The magnitude of the electrostatic force between two point-like charges is given by Coulombs Law. Definition: Coulombs Law Coulombs Law states that the magnitude of the electrostatic force between two point charges is directly proportional to the magnitudes of each charge and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the charges. Q1Q2 r2 and the proportionality constant is called the electrostatic constant and has the value: 899 109N m2 C2. Extension: Similarity of Coulombs Law to the Newtons Universal Law of Gravitation. Notice how similar Coulombs Law is to the form of Newtons Universal Law of Gravitation between two point-like particles: where m1 and m2 are the masses of the two particles is the distance between them and is the gravitational constant. Both laws represent the force exerted by particles (masses or charges) on each other that interact by means of field. It is very interesting that Coulombs Law has been shown to be correct no matter how small the distance nor how large the charge. For example it still applies inside the atom (over distances smaller than 1010m). Next is another example that demonstrates the difference in magnitude between the gravitational force and the electrostatic force. Important: We can apply Newtons Third Law to charges because two charges exert forces of equal magnitude on one another in opposite directions. Important: Coulombs Law When substituting into the Coulombs Law equation it is not necessary to include the signs of the charges. Instead select positive direction. Then forces that tend to move the charge in this direction are added while forces that act in the opposite direction are subtracted. We mentioned in Chapter that charge placed on spherical conductor spreads evenly along the surface. As result if we are far enough from the charged sphere electrostatically it behaves as point-like charge. Thus we can treat spherical conductors (e.g. metallic balls) as point-like charges with all the charge acting at the centre. ,Like Electric charge repel each other while opposite Electric charge attract each other. If the Electric charge are at rest then the Force between them is known as the Electrostatics Force The Electrostatics Force between Electric charge increases when the magnitude of the Electric charge increases or the Distance between the Electric charge decreases. The Electrostatics Force was first studied in detail by Charles Coulomb around 1784. Through his observations he was able to show that the Electrostatics Force between two point-like Electric charge is inversely proportional to the square of the Distance between the objects. He also discovered that the Force is proportional to the product of the Electric charge on the two objects.

241,241,17.3,Electric field around charges,392,We have learnt that objects that carry charge feel forces from all other charged objects. It is useful to determine what the effect of charge would be at every point surrounding it. To do this we need some sort of reference. We know that the force that one charge feels due to another depends on both charges (Q1 and Q2). How then can we talk about forces if we only have one charge? The solution to this dilemma is to introduce test charge. We then determine the force that would be exerted on it if we placed it at certain location. If we do this for every point surrounding charge we know what would happen if we put test charge at any location. This map of what would happen at any point we call an electric field map. It is map of the electric field due to charge. It tells us how large the force on test charge would be and in what direction the force would be. Our map consists of the lines that tell us how the test charge would move if it were placed there.

242,242,17.3.1,Electric field lines,393,The maps depend very much on the charge or charges that the map is being made for. We will start off with the simplest possible case. Take single positive charge with no other charges around it. First we will look at what effects it would have on test charge at number of points. Electric field lines like the magnetic field lines that were studied in Grade 10 are way of representing the electric field at point. Arrows on the field lines indicate the direction of the field i.e. the direction positive test charge would move. Electric field lines therefore point away from positive charges and towards negative charges. Field lines are drawn closer together where the field is stronger. ,The maps depend very much on the Electric charge or Electric charge that the map is being made for.

243,243,17.3.2,Positive charge acting on a test charge,393,At each point we calculate the force on test charge and represent this force by vector. We can see that at every point the positive test charge would experience force pushing it away from the charge Q. This is because both charges are positive and so they repel. Also notice that at points further away the vectors are shorter. That is because the force is smaller if you are further away. Negative charge acting on test charge If the charge were negative we would have the following result. Notice that it is almost identical to the positive charge case. This is important the arrows are the same length because the magnitude of the charge is the same and so is the magnitude of the test charge. Thus the magnitude (size) of the force is the same. The arrows point in the opposite direction because the charges now have opposite sign and so the test charge is attracted to the charge. Now to make things simpler we draw continuous lines showing the path that the test charge would travel. This means we dont have to work out the magnitude of the force at many different points. Some important points to remember about electric fields: There is an electric field at every point in space surrounding charge. Field lines are merely representation they are not real. When we draw them we just pick convenient places to indicate the field in space. Field lines always start at right-angle (90o) to the charged object causing the field. Field lines never cross. ,At each point we calculate the Force on test Electric charge and represent this Force by Euclidean vector We can see that at every point the Position (vector) test Electric charge would experience Force pushing it away from the Electric charge Electric charge This is because both Electric charge are Position (vector) and so they repel.

244,244,17.3.3,Combined charge distributions,394,We will now look at the field of positive charge and negative charge placed next to each other. The net resulting field would be the addition of the fields from each of the charges. To start off with let us sketch the field maps for each of the charges separately. Notice that test charge starting off directly between the two would be pushed away from the positive charge and pulled towards the negative charge in straight line. The path it would follow would be straight line between the charges. Now lets consider test charge starting off bit higher than directly between the charges. If it starts closer to the positive charge the force it feels from the positive charge is greater but the negative charge also attracts it so it would move away from the positive charge with tiny force attracting it towards the negative charge. As it gets further from the positive charge the force from the negative and positive charges change and they are equal in magnitude at equal distances from the charges. After that point the negative charge starts to exert stronger force on the test charge. This means that the test charge moves towards the negative charge with only small force away from the positive charge. Two like charges both positive For the case of two positive charges things look little different. We cant just turn the arrows around the way we did before. In this case the test charge is repelled by both charges. This tells us that test charge will never cross half way because the force of repulsion from both charges will be equal in magnitude. The field directly between the charges cancels out in the middle. The force has equal magnitude and opposite direction. Interesting things happen when we look at test charges that are not on line directly between the two. We know that charge the same distance below the middle will experience force along reflected line because the problem is symmetric (i.e. if we flipped vertically it would look the same). This is also true in the horizontal direction. So we use this fact to easily draw in the next four lines. Two like charges both negative We can use the fact that the direction of the force is reversed for test charge if you change the sign of the charge that is influencing it. If we change to the case where both charges are negative we get the following result: ,We will now look at the Field (physics) of Position (vector) Electric charge and Electric charge placed next to each other.

245,245,17.3.4,Parallel plates,397,One very important example of electric fields which is used extensively is the electric field between two charged parallel plates. In this situation the electric field is constant. This is used for many practical purposes and later we will explain how Millikan used it to measure the charge on the electron. Field map for oppositely charged parallel plates This means that the force that test charge would feel at any point between the plates would be identical in magnitude and direction. The fields on the edges exhibit fringe effects i.e. they bulge outwards. This is because test charge placed here would feel the effects of charges only on one side (either left or right depending on which side it is placed). Test charges placed in the middle experience the effects of charges on both sides so they balance the components in the horizontal direction. This is clearly not the case on the edges. Strength of an electric field When we started making field maps we drew arrows to indicate the strength of the field and the direction. When we moved to lines you might have asked Did we forget about the field strength?. We did not. Consider the case for single positive charge again: Notice that as you move further away from the charge the field lines become more spread out. In field map diagrams the closer field lines are together the stronger the field. Therefore the electric field is stronger closer to the charge (the electric field lines are closer together) and weaker further from the charge (the electric field lines are further apart). The magnitude of the electric field at point as the force per unit charge. Therefore and are vectors. From this we see that the force on charge is simply: The force between two electric charges is given by: Qq r2 (if we make the one charge and the other q.) Therefore the electric field can be written as: r2 The electric field is the force per unit of charge and hence has units of newtons per coulomb. As with Coulombs law calculations do not substitute the sign of the charge into the equation for electric field. Instead choose positive direction and then either add or subtract the contribution to the electric field due to each charge depending upon whether it points in the positive or negative direction respectively. ,One very important example of Electric field which is used extensively is the Electric field between two Electric charge parallel plates.

Consider positive test charge +Q placed at in the electric field of another positive point charge. The test charge moves towards under the influence of the electric field of the other charge.

248,248,17.4.2,Real-world application: lightning,402,Lightning is an atmospheric discharge of electricity usually but not always during rain storm. An understanding of lightning is important for power transmission lines as engineers who need to know about lightning in order to adequately protect lines and equipment. Extension: Formation of lightning 1. Charge separation The first process in the generation of lightning is charge separation. The mechanism by which charge separation happens is still the subject of research. One theory is that opposite charges are driven apart and energy is stored in the electric field between them. Cloud electrification appears to require strong updrafts which carry water droplets upward supercooling them to 10 to 20 oC. These collide with ice crystals to form soft ice-water mixture called graupel. The collisions result in slight positive charge being transferred to ice crystals and slight negative charge to the graupel. Updrafts drive lighter ice crystals upwards causing the cloud top to accumulate increasing positive charge. The heavier negatively charged graupel falls towards the middle and lower portions of the cloud building up an increasing negative charge. Charge separation and accumulation continue until the electrical potential becomes sufficient to initiate lightning discharges which occurs when the gathering of positive and negative charges forms sufficiently strong electric field. 2. Leader formation As thundercloud moves over the Earths surface an equal but opposite charge is induced in the Earth below and the induced ground charge follows the movement of the cloud. An initial bipolar discharge or path of ionized air starts from negatively charged mixed water and ice region in the thundercloud. The discharge ionized channels are called leaders. The negative charged leaders called stepped leader proceed generally downward in number of quick jumps each up to 50 metres long. Along the way the stepped leader may branch into number of paths as it continues to descend. The progression of stepped leaders takes comparatively long time (hundreds of milliseconds) to approach the ground. This initial phase involves relatively small electric current (tens or hundreds of amperes) and the leader is almost invisible compared to the subsequent lightning channel. When step leader approaches the ground the presence of opposite charges on the ground enhances the electric field. The electric field is highest on trees and tall buildings. If the electric field is strong enough conductive discharge (called positive streamer) can develop from these points. As the field increases the positive streamer may evolve into hotter higher current leader which eventually connects to the descending stepped leader from the cloud. It is also possible for many streamers to develop from many different objects simultaneously with only one connecting with the leader and forming the main discharge path. Photographs have been taken on which non-connected streamers are clearly visible. When the two leaders meet the electric current greatly increases. The region of high current propagates back up the positive stepped leader into the cloud with return stroke that is the most luminous part of the lightning discharge. 3. Discharge When the electric field becomes strong enough an electrical discharge (the bolt of lightning) occurs within clouds or between clouds and the ground. During the strike successive portions of air become conductive discharge channel as the electrons and positive ions of air molecules are pulled away from each other and forced to flow in opposite directions. The electrical discharge rapidly superheats the discharge channel causing the air to expand rapidly and produce shock wave heard as thunder. The rolling and gradually dissipating rumble of thunder is caused by the time delay of sound coming from different portions of long stroke. Important: Estimating distance of lightning strike The flash of lightning strike and resulting thunder occur at roughly the same time. But light travels at 300 000 kilometres in second almost million times the speed of sound. Sound travels at the slower speed of 330 ms in the same time so the flash of lightning is seen before thunder is heard. By counting the seconds between the flash and the thunder and dividing by you can estimate your distance from the strike and initially the actual storm cell (in kilometres). ,Lightning is an atmospheric discharge of electricity usually but not always during rain storm.

251,251,17.5.2,Dielectrics,404,The electric field between the plates of capacitor is affected by the substance between them. The substance between the plates is called dielectric. Common substances used as dielectrics are mica perspex air paper and glass. When dielectric is inserted between the plates of parallel plate capacitor the dielectric becomes polarised so an electric field is induced in the dielectric that opposes the field between the plates. When the two electric fields are superposed the new field between the plates becomes smaller. Thus the voltage between the plates decreases so the capacitance increases. In every capacitor the dielectric keeps the charge on one plate from travelling to the other plate. However each capacitor is different in how much charge it allows to build up on the electrodes per voltage applied. When scientists started studying capacitors they discovered the property that the voltage applied to the capacitor was proportional to the maximum charge that would accumulate on the electrodes. The constant that made this relation into an equation was called the capacitance C. The capacitance was different for different capacitors.

255,255,17.6.1,A capacitor in a circuit,406,When capacitor is connected in DC circuit current will flow until the capacitor is fully charged. After that no further current will flow. If the charged capacitor is connected to another circuit with no source of emf in it the capacitor will discharge through the circuit creating potential difference for short time. This is useful for example in camera flash. Initially the electrodes have no net charge. voltage source is applied to charge capacitor. The voltage source creates an electric field causing the electrons to move. The charges move around the circuit stopping at the left electrode. Here they are unable to travel across the dielectric since electrons cannot travel through an insulator. The charge begins to accumulate and an electric field forms pointing from the left electrode to the right electrode. This is the opposite direction of the electric field created by the voltage source. When this electric field is equal to the electric field created by the voltage source the electrons stop moving. The capacitor is then fully charged with positive charge on the left electrode and negative charge on the right electrode. If the voltage is removed the capacitor will discharge. The electrons begin to move because in the absence of the voltage source there is now net electric field. This field is due to the imbalance of charge on the electrodesthe field across the dielectric. Just as the electrons flowed to the positive electrode when the capacitor was being charged during discharge the electrons flow to negative electrode.

The discovery of the relationship between magnetism and electricity was like so many other scientific discoveries stumbled upon almost by accident. The Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted was lecturing one day in 1820 on the possibility of electricity and magnetism being related to one another and in the process demonstrated it conclusively by experiment in front of his whole class. By passing an electric current through metal wire suspended above magnetic compass Oersted was able to produce definite motion of the compass needle in response to the current. What began as guess at the start of the class session was confirmed as fact at the end. Needless to say Oersted had to revise his lecture notes for future classes. His discovery paved the way for whole new branch of science electromagnetism. The magnetic field produced by an electric current is always oriented perpendicular to the direction of the current flow. When we are drawing directions of magnetic fields and currents we use the symbol and The symbol for an arrow that is coming out of the page and the symbol for an arrow that is going into the page. It is easy to remember the meanings of the symbols if you think of an arrow with head and tail. When the arrow is coming out of the page you see the head of the arrow (). When the arrow is going into the page you see the tail of the arrow (). The direction of the magnetic field around the current carrying conductor is shown in Figure 18.1.

261,261,18.3,Current induced by a changing magnetic field,420,While Oersteds surprising discovery of electromagnetism paved the way for more practical applications of electricity it was Michael Faraday who gave us the key to the practical generation of electricity: electromagnetic induction. Faraday discovered that voltage was generated across length of wire while moving magnet nearby such that the distance between the two changed. This meant that the wire was exposed to magnetic field flux of changing intensity. Furthermore the voltage also depended on the orientation of the magnet this is easily understood again in terms of the magnetic flux. The flux will be at its maximum as the magnet is aligned perpendicular to the wire. The magnitude of the changing flux and the voltage are linked. In fact if the lines of flux are parallel to the wire there will be no induced voltage. Definition: Faradays Law The emf produced around loop of conductor is proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux through the area of the loop. This can be stated mathematically as: where and is the strength of the magnetic field. Faradays Law relates induced emf to the rate of change of flux which is the product of the magnetic field and the cross-sectional area the field lines pass through. When the north pole of magnet is pushed into solenoid the flux in the solenoid increases so the induced current will have an associated magnetic field pointing out of the solenoid (opposite to the magnets field). When the north pole is pulled out the flux decreases so the induced current will have an associated magnetic field pointing into the solenoid (same direction as the magnets field) to try to oppose the change. The directions of currents and associated magnetic fields can all be found using only the Right Hand Rule. When the fingers of the right hand are pointed in the direction of the current the thumb points in the direction of the magnetic field. When the thumb is pointed in the direction of the magnetic field the fingers point in the direction of the current. Important: An easy way to create magnetic field of changing intensity is to move permanent magnet next to wire or coil of wire. The magnetic field must increase or decrease in intensity perpendicular to the wire (so that the lines of flux cut across the conductor) or else no voltage will be induced. Important: Finding the direction of the induced current The induced current generates magnetic field. The induced magnetic field is in direction that cancels out the magnetic field in which the conductor is moving. So you can use the Right Hand Rule to find the direction of the induced current by remembering that the induced magnetic field is opposite in direction to the magnetic field causing the change. Electromganetic induction is put into practical use in the construction of electrical generators which use mechanical power to move magnetic field past coils of wire to generate voltage. However this is by no means the only practical use for this principle. If we recall that the magnetic field produced by current-carrying wire was always perpendicular to that wire and that the flux intensity of that magnetic field varied with the amount of current through it we can see that wire is capable of inducing voltage along its own length simply due to change in current through it. This effect is called self-induction. Self-induction is when changing magnetic field is produced by changes in current through wire inducing voltage along the length of that same wire. If the magnetic field flux is enhanced by bending the wire into the shape of coil andor wrapping that coil around material of high permeability this effect of self-induced voltage will be more intense. device constructed to take advantage of this effect is called an inductor and will be discussed in greater detail in the next chapter. Extension: Lenzs Law The induced current will create magnetic field that opposes the change in the magnetic flux. ,While Oersteds surprising discovery of electromagnetism paved the way for more practical applications of electricity it was Michael Faraday who gave us the key to the practical generation of electricity: electromagnetic induction.

263,263,18.4,Transformers,423,One of the real-world applications of Faradays Law is in transformer. Eskom generates electricity at around 22 000 V. When you plug in toaster the mains voltage is 220 V. transformer is used to step-down the high voltage to the lower voltage that is used as mains voltage. Definition: Transformer transformer is an electrical device that uses the principle of induction between the primary coil and the secondary coil to either step-up or step-down voltage. The essential features of transformer are two coils of wire called the primary coil and the secondary coil which are wound around different sections of the same iron core. When an alternating voltage is applied to the primary coil it creates an alternating current in that coil which induces an alternating magnetic field in the iron core. This changing magnetic field induces an emf which creates current in the secondary coil. The circuit symbol for transformer is: very useful property of transformers is the ability to transform voltage and current levels according to simple ratio determined by the ratio of input and output coil turns. We can derive mathematical relationship by using Faradays law. Assume that an alternating voltage Vp is applied to the primary coil (which has Np turns) of transformer. The current that results from this voltage generates magnetic flux p. We can then describe the emf in the primary coil by: Vp Np Similarly for the secondary coil Vs Ns If we assume that the primary and secondary windings are perfectly coupled then: which means that: Vp Vs Np Ns transformer designed to output more voltage than it takes in across the input coil is called step-up transformer. step-up transformer has more windings on the secondary coil than on the primary coil. This means that: Similarly transformer designed to output less than it takes in across the input coil is called step-down transformer. step-down transformer has more windings on the primary coil than on the primary coil. This means that: Np Ns We use step-up transformer to increase the voltage from the primary coil to the secondary coil. It is used at power stations to increase the voltage for the transmission lines. step-down transformer decreases the voltage from the primary coil to the secondary coil. It is particularly used to decrease the voltage from the transmission lines to voltage which can be used in factories and in homes. Transformer technology has made long-range electric power distribution practical. Without the ability to efficiently step voltage up and down it would be cost-prohibitive to construct power systems for anything but close-range (within few kilometres) use. As useful as transformers are they only work with AC not DC. This is because the phenomenon of mutual inductance relies on changing magnetic fields and direct current (DC) can only produce steady magnetic fields transformers simply will not work with direct current. Of course direct current may be interrupted (pulsed) through the primary winding of transformer to create changing magnetic field (as is done in automotive ignition systems to produce high-voltage spark plug power from low-voltage DC battery) but pulsed DC is not that different from AC. Perhaps more than any other reason this is why AC finds such widespread application in power systems. ,One of the real-world applications of Faradays Law is in transformer.

270,270,19.2.1,Definition of Ohm's Law,429,An important relationship between the current voltage and resistance in circuit was discovered by Georg Simon Ohm and is called Ohms Law. Definition: Ohms Law The amount of electric current through metal conductor at constant temperature in circuit is proportional to the voltage across the conductor. Mathematically Ohms Law is written: I. Ohms Law tells us that if conductor is at constant temperature the voltage across the ends of the conductor is proportional to the current. This means that if we plot voltage on the y-axis of graph and current on the x-axis of the graph we will get straight-line. The gradient of the straight-line graph is then the resistance of the conductor. ,An important relationship between the Electric current Voltage and Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance in circuit was discovered by Georg Simon Ohm and is called Ohm Law.

271,271,19.2.2,Ohmic and non-ohmic conductors,431,As you have seen there is mention of constant temperature when we talk about Ohms Law. This is because the resistance of some conductors change as their temperature changes. These types of conductors are called non-ohmic conductors because they do not obey Ohms Law. As can be expected the conductors that obey Ohms Law are called ohmic conductors. light bulb is common example of non-ohmic conductor. Nichrome wire is an ohmic conductor. In light bulb the resistance of the filament wire will increase dramatically as it warms from room temperature to operating temperature. If we increase the supply voltage in real lamp circuit the resulting increase in current causes the filament to increase in temperature which increases its resistance. This effectively limits the increase in current. In this case voltage and current do not obey Ohms Law. The phenomenon of resistance changing with variations in temperature is one shared by almost all metals of which most wires are made. For most applications these changes in resistance are small enough to be ignored. In the application of metal lamp filaments which increase lot in temperature (up to about 1000C and starting from room temperature) the change is quite large. In general non-ohmic conductors have plots of voltage against current that are curved indicating that the resistance is not constant over all values of voltage and current. ,As you have seen there is mention of constant Temperature when we talk about Ohm Law.

274,274,19.3.1,Equivalent resistance,433,When there is more than one resistor in circuit we are usually able to replace all resistors with single resistor whose effect is the same as all the resistors put together. The resistance of the single resistor is known as equivalent resistance. We are able to calculate equivalent resistance for resistors connected in series and parallel. Equivalent Series Resistance Consider circuit consisting of three resistors and single battery connected in series. The first principle to understand about series circuits is that the amount of current is the same through any component in the circuit. This is because there is only one path for electrons to flow in series circuit. From the way that the battery is connected we can tell which direction the current will flow. We know that charge flows from positive to negative by convention. Current in this circuit will flow in clockwise direction from point to to to and back to A. So how do we use this knowledge to calculate the value of single resistor that can replace the three resistors in the circuit and still have the same current? We know that in series circuit the current has to be the same in all components. So we can write: I1 I2 I3 We also know that total voltage of the circuit has to be equal to the sum of the voltages over all three resistors. So we can write: V1 V2 V3 Finally we know that Ohms Law has to apply for each resistor individually which gives us: V1 I1 R1 V2 I2 R2 V3 I3 R3 Therefore: I1 R1 I2 R2 I3 R3 However because I1 I2 I3 we can further simplify this to: R1 R2 R3 I(R1 R2 R3) Further we can write an Ohms Law relation for the entire circuit: Definition: Equivalent resistance in series circuit Rs For resistors in series the equivalent resistance is: Rs R1 R2 R3 Rn Let us apply this to the following circuit. Equivalent parallel resistance Consider circuit consisting of single battery and three resistors that are connected in parallel. The first principle to understand about parallel circuits is that the voltage is equal across all components in the circuit. This is because there are only two sets of electrically common points in parallel circuit and voltage measured between sets of common points must always be the same at any given time. So for the circuit shown the following is true: V1 V2 V3 The second principle for parallel circuit is that all the currents through each resistor must add up to the total current in the circuit.

This means that real batteries are not just sources of potential difference (voltage) but they also possess internal resistances. If the pure voltage source is referred to as the emf then real battery can be represented as an emf connected in series with resistor r. The internal resistance of the battery is represented by the symbol r. Definition: Load The external resistance in the circuit is referred to as the load. Suppose that the battery (or cell) with emf and internal resistance supplies current through an external load resistor R. Then the voltage drop across the load resistor is that supplied by the battery: Similarly from Ohms Law the voltage drop across the internal resistance is: Vr The voltage of the battery is related to its emf and internal resistance by: Ir or Ir The emf of battery is essentially constant because it only depends on the chemical reaction (that converts chemical energy into electrical energy) going on inside the battery. Therefore we can see that the voltage across the terminals of the battery is dependent on the current drawn by the load. The higher the current the lower the voltage across the terminals because the emf is constant. By the same reasoning the voltage only equals the emf when the current is very small.

Just few of the things we could study are how <b>Hardness</b> or soft they are what are their <b>Magnet</b> properties or how well do they conduct heat.

281,281,20.2,Conduction,451,We know that there are materials that do conduct electricity called conductors like the copper wires in the circuits you build. There are also materials that do not conduct electricity called insulators like the plastic covering on the copper wires. Conductors come in two major categories: metals (e.g. copper) and semi-conductors (e.g. silicon). Metals conduct very well and semi-conductors dont. One very interesting difference is that metals conduct less as they become hotter but semi-conductors conduct more. What is different about these substances that makes them conduct differently? That is what we are about to find out. We have learnt that electrons in an atom have discrete energy levels. When an electron is given the right amount of energy it can jump to higher energy level while if it loses the right amount of energy it can drop to lower energy level. The lowest energy level is known as the ground state. When two atoms are far apart from each other they dont influence each other. Look at the picture below. There are two atoms depicted by the black dots. When they are far apart their electron clouds (the gray clouds) are distinct. The dotted line depicts the distance of the outermost electron energy level that is occupied. In some lattice structures the atoms would be closer together. If they are close enough their electron clouds and therefore electron energy levels start to overlap. Look at the picture below. In this picture the two atoms are closer together. The electron clouds now overlap. The overlapping area is coloured in solid gray to make it easier to see. When this happens we might find two electrons with the same energy and spin in the same space. We know that this is not allowed from the Pauli exclusion principle. Something must change to allow the overlapping to happen. The change is that the energies of the energy levels change tiny bit so that the electrons are not in exactly the same spin and energy state at the same time. So if we have atoms then in the overlapping area we will have twice the number of electrons and energy levels but the energy levels from the different atoms will be very very close in energy. If we had atoms then there would be energy levels very close in energy and so on. In solid there may be very many energy levels that are very close in energy. These groups of energy levels are called bands. The spacing between these bands determines whether the solid is conductor or an insulator. In gas the atoms are spaced far apart and they do not influence each other. However the atoms in solid greatly influence each other. The forces that bind these atoms together in solid affect how the electrons of the atoms behave by causing the individual energy levels of an atom to break up and form energy bands. The resulting energy levels are more closely spaced than those in the individual atoms. The energy bands still contain discrete energy levels but there are now many more energy levels than in the single atom. In crystalline solids atoms interact with their neighbors and the energy levels of the electrons in isolated atoms turn into bands. Whether material conducts or not is determined by its band structure. Electrons follow the Pauli exclusion principle meaning that two electrons cannot occupy the same state. Thus electrons in solid fill up the energy bands up to certain level (this is called the Fermi energy). Bands which are completely full of electrons cannot conduct electricity because there is no state of nearby energy to which the electrons can jump. Materials in which all bands are full are insulators. ,We know that there are materials that do conduct electricity called Electrical conductor like the copper wires in the circuits you build. There are also materials that do not conduct electricity called Insulator (electricity) like the Plasticity (physics) covering on the copper wires.

282,282,20.2.1,Metals,453,Metals are good conductors because they have unfilled space in the valence energy band. In the absence of an electric field there are electrons traveling in all directions. When an electric field is applied the mobile electrons flow. Electrons in this band can be accelerated by the electric field because there are plenty of nearby unfilled states in the band. ,Metals are good Electrical conductor because they have unfilled space in the valence Energy band.

283,283,20.2.2,Insulator,453,The energy diagram for the insulator shows the insulator with very wide energy gap. The wider this gap the greater the amount of energy required to move the electron from the valence band to the conduction band. Therefore an insulator requires large amount of energy to obtain small amount of current. The insulator insulates because of the wide forbidden band or energy gap. Breakdown solid with filled bands is an insulator. If we raise the temperature the electrons gain thermal energy. If there is enough energy added then electrons can be thermally excited from the valence band to the conduction band. The fraction of electrons excited in this way depends on: the temperature and the band gap the energy difference between the two bands. Exciting these electrons into the conduction band leaves behind positively charged holes in the valence band which can also conduct electricity. ,The Energy diagram for the Insulator (electricity) shows the Insulator (electricity) with very wide Energy gap.

284,284,20.2.3,Semi-conductors,454,semi-conductor is very similar to an insulator. The main difference between semiconductors and insulators is the size of the band gap between the conduction and valence bands. The band gap in insulators is larger than the band gap in semiconductors. In semi-conductors at room temperature just as in insulators very few electrons gain enough thermal energy to leap the band gap which is necessary for conduction. For this reason pure semi-conductors and insulators in the absence of applied fields have roughly similar electrical properties. The smaller band gaps of semi-conductors however allow for many other means besides temperature to control their electrical properties. The most important one being that for certain amount of applied voltage more current will flow in the semiconductor than in the insulator. ,semi-conductor is very similar to an Insulator (electricity) The main difference between semiconductors and Insulator (electricity) is the size of the band gap between the conduction and valence bands.

285,285,20.3,Intrinsic Properties and Doping,454,We have seen that the size of the energy gap between the valence band and the conduction band determines whether solid is conductor or an insulator. However we have seen that there is material known as semi-conductor. semi-conductor is solid whose band gap is smaller than that of an insulator and whose electrical properties can be modified by process known as doping. Definition: Doping Doping is the deliberate addition of impurities to pure semiconductor material to change its electrical properties. Semiconductors are often the Group IV elements in the periodic table. The most common semiconductor elements are silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge). The most important property of Group IV elements is that they valence electrons. Extension: Band Gaps of Si and Ge Si has band gap of 1.744 1019 while Ge has band gap of 1.152 1019 J. So if we look at the arrangement of for example Si atoms in crystal they would look like that shown in Figure 20.1. The main aim of doping is to make sure there are either too many (surplus) or too few electrons (deficiency).

286,286,20.3.1,Surplus,455,surplus of electrons is created by adding an element that has more valence electrons than Si to the Si crystal. This is known as n-type doping and elements used for n-type doping usually come from Group in the periodic table. Elements from Group have valence electrons one more than the Group IV elements. common n-type dopant (substance used for doping) is arsenic (As). The combination of semiconductor and an n-type dopant is known as an n-type semiconductor. Si crystal doped with As is shown in Figure 20.2. When As is added to Si crystal the of the valence electrons in As bond with the Si valence electrons. The fifth As valence electron is free to move around. It takes only few As atoms to create enough free electrons to allow an electric current to flow through the silicon. Since n-type dopants donate their free atoms to the semiconductor they are known as donor atoms. Figure 20.2: Si crystal doped with As. For each As atom present in the Si crystal there is one extra electron. This combination of Si and As is known as an n-type semiconductor because of its overall surplus of electrons. ,surplus of Electron is created by adding an element that has more valence Electron than Si to the Si crystal.

287,287,20.3.2,Deficiency,455,deficiency of electrons is created by adding an element that has less valence electrons than Si to the Si crystal. This is known as p-type doping and elements used for p-type doping usually come from Group III in the periodic table. Elements from Group III have valence electrons one less than the semiconductor elements that come from Group IV. common p-type dopant is boron (B). The combination of semiconductor and p-type dopant is known as an p-type semiconductor. Si crystal doped with is shown in Figure 20.3. When is mixed into the silicon crystal there is Si valence electron that is left unbonded. The lack of an electron is known as hole and has the effect of positive charge. Holes can conduct current. hole happily accepts an electron from neighbor moving the hole over space. Since p-type dopants accept electrons they are known as acceptor atoms.

Donor (n-type) impurities have extra valence electrons with energies very close to the conduction band which can be easily thermally excited to the conduction band. Acceptor (p-type) impurities capture electrons from the valence band allowing the easy formation of holes. The energy level of the donor atom is close to the conduction band and it is relatively easy for electrons to enter the conduction band.

P-type is where you have more holes N-type is where you have more electrons in the material. Initially when you put them together to form junction holes near the junction tends to move across to the N-region while the electrons in the N-region drift across to the p-region to fill some holes. This current will quickly stop as the potential barrier is built up by the migrated charges. So in steady state no current flows. Then now when you put potential different across the terminals you have two cases: forward biased and reverse biased. ,In p-n junction without an external applied Voltage (no bias) an equilibrium condition is reached in which Voltage is formed across the junction.

Then now when you put Voltage across the terminals you have two cases: forward biased and reverse biased. ,In p-n junction without an external applied <b>Voltage</b> (no bias) an equilibrium condition is reached in which <b>Voltage</b> is formed across the junction. P-type is where you have more holes N-type is where you have more <b>Electron</b> in the material.

292,292,20.4.4,Forward biased,457,Forward-bias occurs when the p-type semiconductor material is connected to the positive terminal of battery and the n-type semiconductor material is connected to the negative terminal. The electric field from the external potential different can easily overcome the small internal field (in the so-called depletion region created by the initial drifting of charges): usually anything bigger than 0.6V would be enough. The external field then attracts more e- to flow from n-region to p-region and more holes from p-region to n-region and you have forward biased situation. the diode is ON. ,Forward-bias occurs when the p-type semiconductor material is connected to the Position (vector) terminal of battery and the n-type semiconductor material is connected to the negative terminal.

Only the small number of thermally released minority carriers (holes in the n-type region and e- in the p-type region) will be able to cross the junction and form very small current but for all practical purposes this can be ignored of course if the reverse biased potential is large enough you get avalanche break down and current flow in the opposite direction.

301,301,21.3,Conservation of Momentum in Two Dimensions,475,We have seen in Chapter ?? that the momentum of system is conserved when there are no external forces acting on the system. Conversely an external force causes change in momentum with the impulse delivered by the force acting for time given by: The same principles that were studied in applying the conservation of momentum to problems in one dimension can be applied to solving problems in two dimensions. The calculation of momentum is the same in two dimensions as in one dimension. The calculation of momentum in two dimensions is broken down into determining the and components of momentum and applying the conservation of momentum to each set of components. Consider two objects moving towards each other as shown in Figure 21.4. We analyse this situation by calculating the and components of the momentum of each object.

303,303,21.4.1,Elastic Collisions,480,Definition: Elastic Collisions An elastic collision is collision where total momentum and total kinetic energy are both conserved. This means that in an elastic collision the total momentum and the total kinetic energy before the collision is the same as after the collision. For these kinds of collisions the kinetic energy is not changed into another type of energy. Before the Collision Figure 21.5 shows two balls rolling toward each other about to collide: Before the balls collide the total momentum of the system is equal to all the individual momenta added together.

304,304,21.4.2,Inelastic Collisions,485,Definition: Inelastic Collisions An inelastic collision is collision in which total momentum is conserved but total kinetic energy is not conserved. The kinetic energy is transformed into other kinds of energy. So the total momentum before an inelastic collisions is the same as after the collision. But the total kinetic energy before and after the inelastic collision is different. Of course this does not mean that total energy has not been conserved rather the energy has been transformed into another type of energy. As rule of thumb inelastic collisions happen when the colliding objects are distorted in some way. Usually they change their shape. The modification of the shape of an object requires energy and this is where the missing kinetic energy goes. classic example of an inelastic collision is motor car accident. The cars change shape and there is noticeable change in the kinetic energy of the cars before and after the collision. This energy was used to bend the metal and deform the cars. Another example of an inelastic collision is shown in Figure 21.7. An asteroid is moving through space towards the Moon. Before the asteroid crashes into the Moon the total momentum of the system is: pi pim pia The total kinetic energy of the system is: KEi KEim KEia When the asteroid collides inelastically with the Moon its kinetic energy is transformed mostly into heat energy. If this heat energy is large enough it can cause the asteroid and the area of the Moons surface that it hits to melt into liquid rock From the force of impact of the asteroid the molten rock flows outwards to form crater on the Moon. After the collision the total momentum of the system will be the same as before. But since this collision is inelastic (and you can see that change in the shape of objects has taken place) total kinetic energy is not the same as before the collision. Momentum is conserved: pi pf But the total kinetic energy of the system is not conserved: Author: Thomas D. Gutierrez Tom Gutierrez received his Bachelor of Science and Master degrees in Physics from San Jose State University in his home town of San Jose California. As Masters student he helped work on laser spectrometer at NASA Ames Research Centre. The instrument measured the ratio of different isotopes of carbon in CO2 gas and could be used for such diverse applications as medical diagnostics and space exploration. Later he received his PhD in physics from the University of California Davis where he performed calculations for various reactions in high energy physics collisions. He currently lives in Berkeley California where he studies proton-proton collisions seen at the STAR experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island New York. High Energy Collisions Take an orange and expand it to the size of the earth. The atoms of the earth-sized orange would themselves be about the size of regular oranges and would fill the entire earth-orange. Now take an atom and expand it to the size of football field. The nucleus of that atom would be about the size of tiny seed in the middle of the field. From this analogy you can see that atomic nuclei are very small objects by human standards. They are roughly 1015 meters in diameter one-hundred thousand times smaller than typical atom. These nuclei cannot be seen or studied via any conventional means such as the naked eye or microscopes. So how do scientists study the structure of very small objects like atomic nuclei? The simplest nucleus that of hydrogen is called the proton. Faced with the inability to isolate single proton open it up and directly examine what is inside scientists must resort to brute-force and somewhat indirect means of exploration: high energy collisions. By colliding protons with other particles (such as other protons or electrons) at very high energies one hopes to learn about what they are made of and how they work. The American physicist Richard Feynman once compared this process to slamming delicate watches together and figuring out how they work by only examining the broken debris. While this analogy may seem pessimistic with sufficient mathematical models and experimental precision considerable information can be extracted from the debris of such high energy subatomic collisions. One can learn about both the nature of the forces at work and also about the sub-structure of such systems. The experiments are in the category of high energy physics (also known as subatomic physics). The primary tool of scientific exploration in these experiments is an extremely violent collision between two very very small subatomic objects such as nuclei. As general rule the higher the energy of the collisions the more detail of the original system you are able to resolve. These experiments are operated at laboratories such as CERN SLAC BNL and Fermilab just to name few. The giant machines that perform the collisions are roughly the size of towns. For example the RHIC collider at BNL is ring about km in diameter and can be seen from space. The newest machine currently being built the LHC at CERN is ring km in diameter ,Definition: Inelastic Collisions An inelastic collision is collision in which total momentum is conserved but total kinetic Energy is not conserved.

The kinetic <b>Energy</b> is transformed into other kinds of <b>Energy</b> So the total momentum before an inelastic collisions is the same as after the collision. But the total kinetic <b>Energy</b> before and after the inelastic collision is different. Of course this does not mean that total <b>Energy</b> has not been conserved rather the <b>Energy</b> has been transformed into another type of <b>Energy</b> As rule of thumb inelastic collisions happen when the <b>Collision</b> objects are distorted in some way. Usually they change their shape. The modification of the shape of an object requires <b>Energy</b> and this is where the missing kinetic <b>Energy</b> goes. classic example of an inelastic collision is motor car accident. The cars change shape and there is noticeable change in the kinetic <b>Energy</b> of the cars before and after the collision. This <b>Energy</b> was used to bend the metal and <b>Deformation (engineering)</b> the cars. Another example of an inelastic collision is shown in Figure 21.7. An asteroid is moving through space towards the Moon. Before the asteroid crashes into the Moon the total momentum of the system is: pi pim pia The total kinetic <b>Energy</b> of the system is: KEi KEim KEia When the asteroid <b>Collision</b> inelastically with the Moon its kinetic <b>Energy</b> is transformed mostly into heat <b>Energy</b> If this heat <b>Energy</b> is large enough it can cause the asteroid and the area of the Moons surface that it hits to melt into liquid rock From the <b>Force</b> of impact of the asteroid the molten rock flows outwards to form crater on the Moon. After the collision the total momentum of the system will be the same as before. But since this collision is inelastic (and you can see that change in the shape of objects has taken place) total kinetic <b>Energy</b> is not the same as before the collision.

307,307,21.5.2,What is a frame of reference?,491,Definition: Frame of Reference frame of reference is the point of view from which system is observed. In practical terms frame of reference is set of axes (specifying directions) with an origin. An observer can then measure the position and motion of all points in system as well as the orientation of objects in the system relative to the frame of reference. There are two types of reference frames: inertial and non-inertial. An inertial frame of reference travels at constant velocity which means that Newtons first law (inertia) holds true. non-inertial frame of reference such as moving car or rotating carousel accelerates. Therefore Newtons first law does not hold true in non-inertial reference frame as objects appear to accelerate without the appropriate forces. ,Definition: Frame of reference Frame of reference is the point of view from which system is observed.

308,308,21.5.3,Why are frames of reference important?,491,Frames of reference are important because (as we have seen in the introductory example) the velocity of car can differ depending on which frame of reference is used. Extension: Frames of Reference and Special Relativity Frames of reference are especially important in special relativity because when frame of reference is moving at some significant fraction of the speed of light then the flow of time in that frame does not necessarily apply in another reference frame. The speed of light is considered to be the only true constant between moving frames of reference. The next worked example will explain this. ,Frame of reference are important because (as we have seen in the introductory example) the Velocity of car can differ depending on which Frame of reference is used.

312,312,22.2,Deformation of materials,503,,,
313,313,22.2.1,Hooke's Law,503,Deformation (change of shape) of solid is caused by force that can either be compressive or tensile when applied in one direction (plane). Compressive forces try to compress the object (make it smaller or more compact) while tensile forces try to tear it apart. We can study these effects by looking at what happens when you compress or expand spring. Hookes Law describes the relationship between the force applied to spring and its extension. Historical Note: Hookes Law Hookes law is named after the seventeenth century physicist Robert Hooke who discovered it in 1660 (18 July 1635 March 1703). Definition: Hookes Law In an elastic spring the extension varies linearly with the force applied. kx where is the force in newtons (N) is the spring constant in m1 and is the extension in metres (m). ,Deformation (engineering) (change of shape) of solid is caused by Force that can either be Compression (physics) or Tension (physics) when applied in one Direction (geometry) (plane).

314,314,22.2.2,Deviation from Hooke's Law,506,We know that if you have small spring and you pull it apart too much it stops working. It bends out of shape and loses its springiness. When this happens Hookes Law no longer applies the springs behaviour deviates from Hookes Law. Depending on what type of material we are dealing the manner in which it deviates from Hookes Law is different. We give classify materials by this deviation. The following graphs show the relationship between force and extension for different materials and they all deviate from Hookes Law. Remember that straight line show proportionality so as soon as the graph is no longer straight line Hookes Law no longer applies. Brittle material This graph shows the relationship between force and extension for brittle but strong material. Note that there is very little extension for large force but then the material suddenly fractures. Brittleness is the property of material that makes it break easily without bending. Have you ever dropped something made of glass and seen it shatter? Glass does this because of its brittleness. Plastic material Here the graph shows the relationship between force and extension for plastic material. The material extends under small force but it does not fracture. Ductile material In this graph the relationship between force and extension is for material that is ductile. The material shows plastic behaviour over range of forces before the material finally fractures. Ductility is the ability of material to be stretched into new shape without breaking. Ductility is one of the characteristic properties of metals. good example of this is aluminium many things are made of aluminium. Aluminium is used for making everything from cooldrink cans to aeroplane parts and even engine blocks for cars. Think about squashing and bending cooldrink can. Brittleness is the opposite of ductility. When material reaches point where Hookes Law is no longer valid we say it has reached its limit of proportionality. After this point the material will not return to its original shape after the force has been removed. We say it has reached its elastic limit. Definition: Elastic limit The elastic limit is the point beyond which permanent deformation takes place. Definition: Limit of proportionality The limit of proportionality is the point beyond which Hookes Law is no longer obeyed. ,We know that if you have small spring and you pull it apart too much it stops Work (physics) It bends out of shape and loses its springiness.

317,317,22.3.2,"Fracture, creep and fatigue",508,Some materials are neither plastic nor elastic. These substances will break or fracture when large enough force is applied to them. The brittle glass we mentioned earlier is an example. Creep occurs when material deforms over long period of time because of an applied force. An example of creep is the bending of shelf over time when heavy object is put on it. Creep may eventually lead to the material fracturing. The application of heat may lead to an increase in creep in material. Fatigue is similar to creep. The difference between the two is that fatigue results from the force being applied and then removed repeatedly over period of time. With metals this results in failure because of metal fatigue. Fracture is an abrupt breaking of the material. Creep is slow deformation process due to continuous force over long time. Fatigue is weakening of the material due to short forces acting many many times. ,Some materials are neither Plasticity (physics) nor Elasticity (physics) These substances will break or Fracture when large enough Force is applied to them.

318,318,22.4,Failure and strength of materials,509,,,
319,319,22.4.1,The properties of matter,509,The strength of material is defined as the stress (the force per unit cross-sectional area) that it can withstand. Strength is measured in newtons per square metre (N m2). Stiffness is measure of how flexible material is. In Science we measure the stiffness of material by calculating its Youngs Modulus. The Youngs modulus is ratio of how much it bends to the load applied to it. Stiffness is measure in newtons per metre (N m1). Hardness of material can be measured by determining what force will cause permanent deformation in the material. Hardness can also be measured using scale like Mohs hardness scale. On this scale diamond is the hardest at 10 and talc is the softest at 1. Remembering that the Mohs scale is the hardness scale and that the softest substance is talc will often come in handy for general knowledge quizes. The toughness of material is measure of how it can resist breaking when it is stressed. It is scientifically defined as the amount of energy that material can absorb before breaking. ductile material is substance that can undergo large plastic deformation without fracturing. Many metals are very ductile and they can be drawn into wires e.g. copper silver aluminium and gold. malleable material is substance that can easily undergo plastic deformation by hammering or rolling. Again metals are malleable substances e.g. copper can be hammered into sheets and aluminium can be rolled into aluminium foil. brittle material fractures with very little or no plastic deformation. Glassware and ceramics are brittle. ,The Strength of materials of material is defined as the stress (the Force per unit cross-sectional area) that it can withstand.

320,320,22.4.2,Structure and failure of materials,509,Many substances fail because they have weakness in their atomic structure. There are number of problems that can cause these weaknesses in structure. These are vacancies dislocations grain boundaries and impurities. Vacancies occur when there are spaces in the structure of crystalline solid. These vacancies cause weakness and the substance often fail at these places. Think about bricks in wall if you started removing bricks the wall would get weaker. Dislocations occur when there are no strong bonds between two rows in crystal lattice. The crystal will fail along this boundary when sufficient force is applied. The two pieces of the crystal keep their shape and structure but move along the boundary.

321,321,22.4.3,Controlling the properties of materials,509,There are number of processes that can be used to ensure that materials are less likely to fail. We shall look at few methods in this section. Cold working Cold working is process in which metal is strengthened by repeatedly being reshaped. This is carried out at temperature below the melting point of the metal. The repeated shaping of the metal result in dislocations which then prevent further dislocations in the metal. Cold working increases the strength of the metal but in so doing the metal loses its ductility. We say the metal is work-hardened. Annealing Annealing is process in which metal is heated strongly to temperature that is about half of its melting point. When the metal cools it recrystallises which removes vacancies and dislocations in the metal. Annealing is often used before cold working. In annealing the metal cools very very slowly. Alloying An alloy is mixture of metal with other substances. The other substances can be metal or non-metal. An alloy often has properties that are very different to the properties of the substances from which it is made. The added substances strengthen the metal by preventing dislocations from spreading. Ordinary steel is an alloy of iron and carbon. There are many types of steel that also include other metals with iron and carbon. Brass is an alloy of copper and Zinc. Bronze is an alloy of copper and tin. Gold and silver that is used in coins or jewellery are also alloyed. Tempering Tempering is process in which metal is melted then quickly cooled. The rapid cooling is called quenching. Usually tempering is done number of times before metal has the correct properties that are needed for particular application. Sintering Sintering is used for making ceramic objects among other things. In this process the substance is heated so that its particles stick together. It is used with substances that have very high melting point. The resulting product is often very pure and it is formed in the process into the shape that is wanted. Unfortunately sintered products are brittle. ,There are number of processes that can be used to ensure that materials are less likely to fail. We shall look at few methods in this section.

One would definitely say yes However in Physics she is not doing any work Again imagine boy pushing against wall? Is he doing any work? We can see that his muscles are contracting and expanding. He may even be sweating. But in Physics he is not doing any work If the vendor is carrying very heavy load for long distance we would say she has lot of energy. By this we mean that she has lot of stamina. If car can travel very fast we describe the car as powerful. So there is link between power and speed. However power means something different in Physics. This chapter describes the links between work energy and power and what these mean in Physics. You will learn that work and energy are closely related. You shall see that the energy of an object is its capacity to do work and doing work is the process of transferring energy from one object or form to another. In other words an object with lots of energy can do lots of work. when work is done energy is lost by the object doing work and gained by the object on which the work is done. Lifting objects or throwing them requires that you do work on them. Even making electricity flow requires that something do work.

325,325,23.2,Work,513,Definition: Work When force exerted on an object causes it to move work is done on the object (except if the force and displacement are at right angles to each other). This means that in order for work to be done an object must be moved distance by force such that there is some non-zero component of the force in the direction of the displacement. Work is calculated as: cos where is the applied force is the displacement of the object and is the angle between the applied force and the direction of motion. Figure 23.1: The force causes the object to be displaced by at angle It is very important to note that for work to be done there must be component of the applied force in the direction of motion. Forces perpendicular to the direction of motion do no work. For example work is done on the object in Figure 23.2 Figure 23.2: (a) The force causes the object to be displaced by in the same direction as the force. 180 and cos 1. Work is done in this situation. (b) force is applied to the object. The object is displaced by at right angles to the force. 90 and cos 0. Work is not done in this situation. Important: The Meaning of The angle is the angle between the force vector and the displacement vector. In the following situations 0. As with all physical quantities work must have units. Following from the definition work is measured in Nm. The name given to this combination of S.I. units is the joule (symbol J). Definition: Joule joule is the work done when an object is moved under the application of force of in the direction of motion. The work done by an object can be positive or negative. Since force (Fk) and displacement (s) are both vectors the result of the above equation depends on their directions: If Fk acts in the same direction as the motion then positive work is being done. In this case the object on which the force is applied gains energy. If the direction of motion and Fk are opposite then negative work is being done. This means that energy is transferred in the opposite direction. For example if you try to push car uphill by applying force up the slope and instead the car rolls down the hill you are doing negative work on the car. Alternatively the car is doing positive work on you Important: The everyday use of the word work differs from the physics use. In physics only the component of the applied force that is parallel to the motion does work on an object. So for example person holding up heavy book does no work on the book. ,Definition: Work (physics) When Force exerted on an object causes it to move Work (physics) is done on the object (except if the Force and Displacement (vector) are at right angles to each other).

326,326,23.3,Energy,519,,,
327,327,23.3.1,External and Internal Forces,519,In Grade 10 you saw that mechanical energy was conserved in the absence of external forces. It is important to know whether force is an internal force or an external force because this is related to whether the force can change an objects total mechanical energy when it does work upon an object. When an external force (for example friction air resistance applied force) does work on an object the total mechanical energy (KE PE) of that object changes. If positive work is done then the object will gain energy. If negative work is done then the object will lose energy. The gain or loss in energy can be in the form of potential energy kinetic energy or both. However the work which is done is equal to the change in mechanical energy of the object. When an internal force does work on an object by an (for example gravitational and spring forces) the total mechanical energy (KE PE) of that object remains constant but the objects energy can change form. For example as an object falls in gravitational field from high elevation to lower elevation some of the objects potential energy is changed into kinetic energy. However the sum of the kinetic and potential energies remain constant. When the only forces doing work are internal forces energy changes forms from kinetic to potential (or vice versa) yet the total amount of mechanical is conserved. ,In Grade 10 you saw that Mechanical energy was conserved in the absence of external Force It is important to know whether Force is an internal Force or an external Force because this is related to whether the Force can change an objects total Mechanical energy when it does Work (physics) upon an object.

328,328,23.3.2,Capacity to do Work,520,Energy is the capacity to do work. When positive work is done on an object the system doing the work loses energy. In fact the energy lost by system is exactly equal to the work done by the system. An object with larger potential energy has greater capacity to do work. This leads us to the work-energy theorem. Definition: Work-Energy Theorem The work-energy theorem states that the work done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy: KE KEf KEi The work-energy theorem is another example of the conservation of energy which you saw in Grade 10. Important: force only does work on an object for the time that it is in contact with the object. For example person pushing trolley does work on the trolley but the road does no work on the tyres of car if they turn without slipping (the force is not applied over any distance because different piece of tyre touches the road every instant. Important: Energy Conservation In the absence of friction the work done on an object by system is equal to the energy gained by the object. Work Done Energy Transferred In the presence of friction only some of the energy lost by the system is transferred to useful energy. The rest is lost to friction. Total Work Done Useful Work Done Work Done Against Friction In the example of falling mass the potential energy is known as gravitational potential energy as it is the gravitational force exerted by the earth which causes the mass to accelerate towards the ground. The gravitational field of the earth is what does the work in this case. Another example is rubber-band. In order to stretch rubber-band we have to do work on it. This means we transfer energy to the rubber-band and it gains potential energy. This potential energy is called elastic potential energy. Once released the rubber-band begins to move and elastic potential energy is transferred into kinetic energy. ,Energy is the capacity to do Work (physics) When Position (vector) Work (physics) is done on an object the system doing the Work (physics) loses Energy In fact the Energy lost by system is exactly equal to the Work (physics) done by the system.

For example person pushing trolley does <b>Work (physics)</b> on the trolley but the road does no <b>Work (physics)</b> on the tyres of car if they turn without slipping (the <b>Force</b> is not applied over any <b>Distance</b> because different piece of tyre touches the road every instant. Important: <b>Energy</b> Conservation In the absence of <b>Friction</b> the <b>Work (physics)</b> done on an object by system is equal to the <b>Energy</b> gained by the object. <b>Work (physics)</b> Done <b>Energy</b> Transferred In the presence of <b>Friction</b> only some of the <b>Energy</b> lost by the system is transferred to useful <b>Energy</b> The rest is lost to <b>Friction</b> Total <b>Work (physics)</b> Done Useful <b>Work (physics)</b> Done <b>Work (physics)</b> Done Against <b>Friction</b> In the example of falling <b>Mass</b> the <b>Potential energy</b> is known as gravitational <b>Potential energy</b> as it is the gravitational <b>Force</b> exerted by the earth which causes the <b>Mass</b> to accelerate towards the ground. The <b>Gravitational field</b> of the earth is what does the <b>Work (physics)</b> in this case. Another example is rubber-band. In order to stretch rubber-band we have to do <b>Work (physics)</b> on it.

329,329,23.4,Power,525,Now that we understand the relationship between work and energy we are ready to look at quantity that defines how long it takes for certain amount of work to be done. For example mother pushing trolley full of groceries can take 30 or 60 to push the trolley down an aisle. She does the same amount of work but takes different length of time. We use the idea of power to describe the rate at which work is done. Definition: Power Power is defined as the rate at which work is done or the rate at which energy is expended. The mathematical definition for power is: The unit watt is named after Scottish inventor and engineer James Watt (19 January 1736 19 August 1819) whose improvements to the steam engine were fundamental to the Industrial Revolution. key feature of it was that it brought the engine out of the remote coal fields into factories. Historically the horsepower (symbol hp) was the unit used to describe the power delivered by machine. One horsepower is equivalent to approximately 750 W. The horsepower is sometimes used in the motor industry to describe the power output of an engine. Incidentally the horsepower was derived by James Watt to give an indication of the power of his steam engine in terms of the power of horse which was what most people used to for example turn mill wheel. Machines are designed and built to do work on objects. All machines usually have power rating. The power rating indicates the rate at which that machine can do work upon other objects. car engine is an example of machine which is given power rating. The power rating relates to how rapidly the car can accelerate. Suppose that 50 kW engine could accelerate the car from km hr1 to 60km hr1 in 16 s. Then car with four times the power rating (i.e. 200 kW) could do the same amount of work in quarter of the time. That is 200 kW engine could accelerate the same car from km hr1 to 60km hr1 in s. ,Now that we understand the relationship between Work (physics) and Energy we are ready to look at quantity that defines how long it takes for certain amount of Work (physics) to be done.

332,332,24.1,Introduction,533,Have you noticed how the pitch of car hooter changes as the car passes by or how the pitch of radio box on the pavement changes as you drive by?

333,333,24.2,The Doppler Effect with Sound and Ultrasound,533,As seen in the introduction there are two situations which lead to the Doppler Effect: 1. When the source moves relative to the observer for example the pitch of car hooter as it passes by. 2. When the observer moves relative to the source for example the pitch of radio on the pavement as you drive by. Definition: Doppler Effect The Doppler effect is the apparent change in frequency and wavelength of wave when the observer and the source of the wave move relative to each other. We experience the Doppler effect quite often in our lives without realising that it is science taking place. The changing sound of taxi hooter or ambulance as it drives past are examples of this as you have seen in the introduction. The question is how does the Doppler effect take place. Let us consider source of sound waves with constant frequency and amplitude. The sound waves can be drawn as concentric circles where each circle represents another wavefront like in figure 24.1 below. The sound source is the dot in the middle and is stationary. For the Doppler effect to take place the source must be moving. Lets consider the following situation: The source (dot) emits one peak (represented by circle) that moves away from the source at the same rate in all directions. As this peak moves away the source also moves and then emits the second peak. Now the two circles are not concentric any more but on the one side they are closer together and on the other side they are further apart. This is shown in the next diagram. If the source continues moving at the same speed in the same direction (i.e. with the same velocity which you will learn more about later). then the distance between peaks on the right of the source is the constant. The distance between peaks on the left is also constant but they are different on the left and right. This means that the time between peaks on the right is less so the frequency is higher. It is higher than on the left and higher than if the source were not moving at all. On the left hand side the peaks are further apart than on the right and further apart than if the source were at rest this means the frequency is lower. When car appoaches you the sound waves that reach you have shorter wavelength and higher frequency. You hear higher sound. When the car moves away from you the sound waves that reach you have longer wavelength and lower frequency. You hear lower sound. This change in frequency can be calculated by using: where fL is the frequency perceived by the listener fS is the frequency of the source is the speed of the waves vL the speed of the listener and vS the speed of the source. Radar-based speed-traps use the Doppler Effect. The radar gun emits radio waves of specific frequency. When the car is standing still the waves reflected waves are the same frequency as the waves emitted by the radar gun. When the car is moving the Doppler frequency shift can be used to determine the speed of the car. ,As seen in the introduction there are two situations which lead to the Doppler effect 1. When the source moves relative to the observer for example the Pitch (music) of car hooter as it passes by. 2.

334,334,24.2.1,Ultrasound and the Doppler Effect,537,Ultrasonic waves (ultrasound) are sound waves with frequency greater than 20 000 Hz (the upper limit of hearing). These waves can be used in medicine to determine the direction of blood flow. The device called Doppler flow meter sends out sound waves. The sound waves can travle through skin and tissue and will be reflected by moving objects in the body (like blood). The reflected waves return to the flow meter where its frequency (received frequency) is compared to the transmitted frequency. Because of the Doppler effect blood that is moving towards the flow meter will change the sound to higher frequency (blue shift) and blood that is moving away from the flow meter will cause lower frequency (red shift). Ultrasound can be used to determine whether blood is flowing in the right direction in the circulation system of unborn babies or identify areas in the body where blood flow is restricted due to narrow veins. The use of ultrasound equipment in medicine is called sonography or ultrasonography. ,Ultrasonic Wave (ultrasound) are Sound Wave with Frequency greater than 20 000 Hertz (the upper limit of hearing).

335,335,24.3,The Doppler Effect with Light,537,Light is wave and earlier you learnt how you can study the properties of one wave and apply the same ideas to another wave. The same applies to sound and light. We know the Doppler effect affects sound waves when the source is moving. Therefore if we apply the Doppler effect to light the frequency of the emitted light should change when the source of the light is moving relative to the observer. When the frequency of sound wave changes the sound you hear changes. When the frequency of light changes the colour you would see changes. This means that the Doppler effect can be observed by change in sound (for sound waves) and change in colour (for light waves). Keep in mind that there are sounds that we cannot hear (for example ultrasound) and light that we cannot see (for example ultraviolet light). We can apply all the ideas that we learnt about the Doppler effect to light. When talking about light we use slightly different names to describe what happens. If you look at the colour spectrum (more details Chapter 30) then you will see that blue light has shorter wavelengths than red light. If you are in the middle of the visible colours then longer wavelengths are more red and shorter wavelengths are more blue. So we call shifts towards longer wavelengths red-shifts and shifts towards shorter wavelengths blue-shifts. shift in wavelength is the same as shift in frequency. Longer wavelengths of light have lower frequencies and shorter wavelengths have higher frequencies. From the Doppler effect we know that when things move towards you any waves they emit that you measure are shifted to shorter wavelengths (blueshifted). If things move away from you the shift is to longer wavelengths (redshifted). ,Light is Wave and earlier you learnt how you can study the properties of one Wave and apply the same ideas to another Wave The same applies to Sound and Light We know the Doppler effect affects Sound Wave when the source is moving. Therefore if we apply the Doppler effect to Light the Frequency of the emitted Light should change when the source of the Light is moving relative to the observer. When the Frequency of Sound Wave changes the Sound you hear changes. When the Frequency of Light changes the Color you would see changes. This means that the Doppler effect can be observed by change in Sound (for Sound Wave and change in Color (for Light Wave Keep in mind that there are Sound that we cannot hear (for example ultrasound) and Light that we cannot see (for example ultraviolet Light We can apply all the ideas that we learnt about the Doppler effect to Light When talking about Light we use slightly different names to describe what happens.

336,336,24.3.1,The Expanding Universe,538,Stars emit light which is why we can see them at night. Galaxies are huge collections of stars. An example is our own Galaxy the Milky Way of which our sun is only one of the millions of stars Using large telescopes like the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) in the Karoo astronomers can measure the light from distant galaxies. The spectrum of light (see Chapter ??) can tell us what elements are in the stars in the galaxies because each element emitsabsorbs light at particular wavelengths (called spectral lines). If these lines are observed to be shifted from their usual wavelengths to shorter wavelengths then the light from the galaxy is said to be blueshifted. If the spectral lines are shifted to longer wavelengths then the light from the galaxy is said to be redshifted. If we think of the blueshift and redshift in Doppler effect terms then blueshifted galaxy would appear to be moving towards us (the observers) and redshifted galaxy would appear to be moving away from us. Important: If the light source is moving away from the observer (positive velocity) then the observed frequency is lower and the observed wavelength is greater (redshifted). If the source is moving towards (negative velocity) the observer the observed fre- quency is higher and the wavelength is shorter (blueshifted). Edwin Hubble (20 November 1889 28 September 1953) measured the Doppler shift of large sample of galaxies. He found that the light from distant galaxies is redshifted and he discovered that there is proportionality relationship between the redshift and the distance to the galaxy. Galaxies that are further away always appear more redshifted than nearby galaxies. Remember that redshift in Doppler terms means velocity of the light source away from the observer. So why do all distant galaxies appear to be moving away from our Galaxy? The reason is that the universe is expanding The galaxies are not actually moving themselves rather the space between them is expanding ,Stars emit Light which is why we can see them at night.

338,338,25.1,Introduction,541,We call the light that we humans can see visible light. Visible light is actually just small part of the large spectrum of electromagnetic radiation which you will learn more about in Chapter 30. We can think of electromagnetic radiation and visible light as transverse waves. We know that transverse waves can be described by their amplitude frequency (or wavelength) and velocity. The velocity of wave is given by the product of its frequency and wavelength: (25.1) However electromagnetic radiation including visible light is special because no matter what the frequency it all moves at constant velocity (in vacuum) which is known as the speed of light. The speed of light has the symbol and is: 108 m.s1 Since the speed of light is we can then say: ,We call the Light that we humans can see visible Light Visible Light is actually just small part of the large spectrum of Electromagnetic radiation which you will learn more about in Chapter 30.

339,339,25.2,Colour and Light,541,Our eyes are sensitive to visible light over range of wavelengths from 390 nm to 780 nm (1 nm 109 m). The different colours of light we see are related to specific frequencies (and wavelengths) of visible light. The wavelengths and frequencies are listed in table 25.1. You can see from table 25.1 that violet light has the shortest wavelengths and highest frequencies while red light has the longest wavelengths and lowest frequencies. ,Our eyes are sensitive to visible Light over range of Wavelength from 390 nm to 780 nm (1 nm 109 m).

340,340,25.2.1,Dispersion of white light,544,White light like the light which comes from the sun is made up of all the visible wavelengths of light. In other words white light is combination of all the colours of visible light. In Chapter you learnt that the speed of light is different in different substances. The speed of light in different substances depends on the frequency of the light. For example when white light travels through glass light of the different frequencies is slowed down by different amounts. The lower the frequency the less the speed is reduced which means that red light (lowest frequency) is slowed down less than violet light (highest frequency). We can see this when white light is incident on glass prism. Have look at the picture below. When the white light hits the edge of the prism the light which travels through the glass is refracted as it moves from the less dense medium (air) to the more dense medium (glass). The red light which is slowed down the least is refracted the least. The violet light which is slowed down the most is refracted the most. When the light hits the other side of the prism it is again refracted but the angle of the prism edge allows the light to remain separated into its different colours. White light is therefore separated into its different colours by the prism and we say that the white light has been dispersed by the prism. The dispersion effect is also responsible for why we see rainbows. When sunlight hits drops of water in the atmosphere the white light is dispersed into its different colours by the water. ,White Light like the Light which comes from the sun is made up of all the visible Wavelength of Light In other words white Light is combination of all the Color of visible Light In Chapter you learnt that the Speed of Light is different in different substances.

342,342,25.3.1,Additive Primary Colours,544,The primary colours of light are red green and blue. When all the primary colours are superposed (added together) white light is produced. Red green and blue are therefore called the additive primary colours. All the other colours can be produced by different combinations of red green and blue. ,The primary Color of Light are red green and blue.

The subtractive primary colours are yellow magenta and cyan. Magenta appears as pinkish-purplish colour and cyan looks greenish-blue. You can see how the primary colours of light add up to the different subtractive colours in the illustration below. ,The subtractive primary Color are obtained by subtracting one of the three additive primary Color from white Light The subtractive primary Color are yellow magenta and cyan.

345,345,25.3.4,Perception of Colour,546,The light-sensitive lining on the back inside half of the human eye is called the retina. The retina contains two kinds of light sensitive cells or photoreceptors: the rod cells (sensitive to low light) and the cone cells (sensitive to normal daylight) which enable us to see. The rods are not very sensitive to colour but work well in dimly lit conditions. This is why it is possible to see in dark room but it is hard to see any colours. Only your rods are sensitive to the low light levels and so you can only see in black white and grey. The cones enable us to see colours. Normally there are three kinds of cones each containing different pigment. The cones are activated when the pigments absorb light. The three types of cones are sensitive to (i.e. absorb) red blue and green light respectively. Therefore we can perceive all the different colours in the visible spectrum when the different types of cones are stimulated by different amounts since they are just combinations of the three primary colours of light. The rods and cones have different response times to light. The cones react quickly when bright light falls on them. The rods take longer time to react. This is why it takes while (about 10 minutes) for your eyes to adjust when you enter dark room after being outside on sunny day. Color blindness in humans is the inability to perceive differences between some or all colors that other people can see. Most often it is genetic problem but may also occur because of eye nerve or brain damage or due to exposure to certain chemicals. The most common forms of human color blindness result from problems with either the middle or long wavelength sensitive cone systems and involve difficulties in discriminating reds yellows and greens from one another. This is called red-green color blindness. Other forms of color blindness are much rarer. They include problems in discriminating blues from yellows and the rarest forms of all complete color blindness or monochromasy where one cannot distinguish any color from grey as in black-and-white movie or photograph. ,The light-sensitive lining on the back inside half of the human eye is called the retina.

These dots are caused to fluoresce (glow brightly) when beam of electrons from the cathode-ray tube behind the screen hits them.

But what gives everyday objects around us their different colours? Pigments are substances which give an object its colour by absorbing certain frequencies of light and reflecting other frequencies. For example red pigment absorbs all colours of light except red which it reflects. Paints and inks contain pigments which gives the paints and inks different colours. ,We have learnt that white Light is combination of all the Color of the visible spectrum and that each Color of Light is related to different Frequency But what gives everyday objects around us their different Color Pigment are substances which give an object its Color by absorbing certain Frequency of Light and Reflection (physics) other Frequency For example red Pigment absorbs all Color of Light except red which it Reflection (physics) Paints and inks contain Pigment which gives the paints and inks different Color ,We have learnt that white <b>Light</b> is combination of all the <b>Color</b> of the visible spectrum and that each <b>Color</b> of <b>Light</b> is related to different <b>Frequency</b> But what gives everyday objects around us their different <b>Color</b> <b>Pigment</b> are substances which give an object its <b>Color</b> by absorbing certain <b>Frequency</b> of <b>Light</b> and <b>Reflection (physics)</b> other <b>Frequency</b> For example red <b>Pigment</b> absorbs all <b>Color</b> of <b>Light</b> except red which it <b>Reflection (physics)</b> Paints and inks contain <b>Pigment</b> which gives the paints and inks different <b>Color</b>
348,348,25.4.1,Colour of opaque objects,548,Objects which you cannot see through (i.e. they are not transparent) are called opaque. Examples of some opaque objects are metals wood and bricks. The colour of an opaque object is determined by the colours (therefore frequencies) of light which it reflects. For example when white light strikes blue opaque object such as ruler the ruler will absorb all frequencies of light except blue which will be reflected. The reflected blue light is the light which makes it into our eyes and therefore the object will appear blue. Opaque objects which appear white do not absorb any light. They reflect all the frequencies. Black opaque objects absorb all frequencies of light. They do not reflect at all and therefore appear to have no colour. ,Objects which you cannot see through (i.e. they are not transparent) are called opaque.

349,349,25.4.2,Colour of transparent objects,548,If an object is transparent it means that you can see through it. For example glass clean water and some clear plastics are transparent. The colour of transparent object is determined by the colours (frequencies) of light which it transmits (allows to pass through it). For example cup made of green glass will appear green because it absorbs all the other frequencies of light except green which it transmits.

If each source emits waves isotropically (i.e. the same in all directions) we will get the situation shown in as shown in Figure 26.1. We define wavefront as the imaginary line that joins waves that are in phase. These are indicated by the grey vertical lines in Figure 26.1.

354,354,26.3,The Huygens Principle,554,Christiaan Huygens described how to determine the path of waves through medium. Definition: The Huygens Principle Each point on wavefront acts like point source of circular waves. The waves emitted from these point sources interfere to form another wavefront. simple example of the Huygens Principle is to consider the single wavefront in Figure 26.2. Christiaan Huygens (14 April 1629 July 1695) was Dutch mathematician astronomer and physicist born in The Hague as the son of Constantijn Huygens. He studied law at the University of Leiden and the College of Orange in Breda before turning to science. Historians commonly associate Huygens with the scientific revolution. Huygens generally receives minor credit for his role in the development of modern calculus. He also achieved note for his arguments that light consisted of waves see: wave-particle duality. In 1655 he discovered Saturns moon Titan. He also examined Saturns planetary rings and in 1656 he discovered that those rings consisted of rocks. In the same year he observed and sketched the Orion Nebula. He also discovered several interstellar nebulae and some double stars. ,Christiaan Huygens described how to determine the path of Wave through medium.

355,355,26.4,Interference,556,Interference occurs when two identical waves pass through the same region of space at the same time resulting in superposition of waves. There are two types of interference which is of interest: constructive interference and destructive interference. Constructive interference occurs when both waves have displacement in the same direction while destructive interference occurs when one wave has displacement in the opposite direction to the other thereby resulting in cancellation. There is no displacement of the medium in destructive interference while for constructive interference the displacement of the medium is greater than the individual displacements. Constructive interference occurs when both waves have displacement in the same direction this means they both have peak or they both have trough at the same place at the same time. If they both have peak then the peaks add together to form bigger peak. If they both have trough then the trough gets deeper. Destructive interference occurs when one wave has displacement in the opposite direction to the other this means that the one wave has peak and the other wave has trough. If the waves have identical magnitudes then the peak fills up the trough and the medium will look like there are no waves at that point. There will be no displacement of the medium. place where destructive interference takes places is called node. Waves can interfere at places where there is never trough and trough or peak and peak or trough and peak at the same time. At these places the waves will add together and the resultant displacement will be the sum of the two waves but they wont be points of maximum interference. Consider the two identical waves shown in the picture below. The wavefronts of the peaks are shown as black lines while the wavefronts of the troughs are shown as grey lines. You can see that the black lines cross other black lines in many places. This means two peaks are in the same place at the same time so we will have constructive interference where the two peaks add together to form bigger peak. Two points sources (A and B) radiate identical waves. The wavefronts of the peaks (black lines) and troughs (grey lines) are shown. Constructive interference occurs where two black lines intersect or where two gray lines intersect. Destructive interference occurs where black line intersects with grey line. You can see that the black lines cross other black lines in many places. This means two peaks are in the same place at the same time so we will have constructive interference where the two peaks add together to form bigger peak. When the grey lines cross other grey lines there are two troughs are in the same place at the same time so we will have constructive interference where the two troughs add together to form bigger trough.

To see if you understand it cover up the half we have marked with diamonds and try to work out which points are constructive and destructive on the other half of the picture. The two halves are mirror images of each other so you can check yourself. ,Interference occurs when two identical Wave pass through the same region of space at the same time resulting in superposition of Wave There are two types of interference which is of interest: constructive interference and destructive interference. Constructive interference occurs when both Wave have Displacement (vector) in the same Direction (geometry) while destructive interference occurs when one Wave has Displacement (vector) in the opposite Direction (geometry) to the other thereby resulting in cancellation. There is no Displacement (vector) of the medium in destructive interference while for constructive interference the Displacement (vector) of the medium is greater than the individual Displacement (vector) Constructive interference occurs when both Wave have Displacement (vector) in the same Direction (geometry) this means they both have peak or they both have Crest (physics) at the same place at the same time. If they both have peak then the peaks add together to form bigger peak. If they both have Crest (physics) then the Crest (physics) gets deeper. Destructive interference occurs when one Wave has Displacement (vector) in the opposite Direction (geometry) to the other this means that the one Wave has peak and the other Wave has Crest (physics) If the Wave have identical magnitudes then the peak fills up the Crest (physics) and the medium will look like there are no Wave at that point. There will be no Displacement (vector) of the medium. place where destructive interference takes places is called node. Wave can interfere at places where there is never Crest (physics) and Crest (physics) or peak and peak or Crest (physics) and peak at the same time. At these places the Wave will add together and the resultant Displacement (vector) will be the sum of the two Wave but they wont be points of maximum interference. Consider the two identical Wave shown in the picture below. The wavefronts of the peaks are shown as black lines while the wavefronts of the Crest (physics) are shown as grey lines. You can see that the black lines cross other black lines in many places. This means two peaks are in the same place at the same time so we will have constructive interference where the two peaks add together to form bigger peak. Two points sources (A and B) radiate identical Wave The wavefronts of the peaks (black lines) and Crest (physics) (grey lines) are shown. Constructive interference occurs where two black lines intersect or where two gray lines intersect. Destructive interference occurs where black line intersects with grey line. You can see that the black lines cross other black lines in many places.

356,356,26.5,Diffraction,557,One of the most interesting and also very useful properties of waves is diffraction. Definition: Diffraction Diffraction is the ability of wave to spread out in wavefronts as the wave passes through small aperture or around sharp edge. Extension: Diffraction Diffraction refers to various phenomena associated with wave propagation such as the bending spreading and interference of waves emerging from an aperture. It occurs with any type of wave including sound waves water waves electromagnetic waves such as light and radio waves. While diffraction always occurs its effects are generally only noticeable for waves where the wavelength is on the order of the feature size of the diffracting objects or apertures. For example if two rooms are connected by an open doorway and sound is produced in remote corner of one of them person in the other room will hear the sound as if it originated at the doorway. As far as the second room is concerned the vibrating air in the doorway is the source of the sound. The same is true of light passing the edge of an obstacle but this is not as easily observed because of the short wavelength of visible light. This means that when waves move through small holes they appear to bend around the sides because there are not enough points on the wavefront to form another straight wavefront. This is bending round the sides we call diffraction. Extension: Diffraction Diffraction effects are more clear for water waves with longer wavelengths. Diffraction can be demonstrated by placing small barriers and obstacles in ripple tank and observing the path of the water waves as they encounter the obstacles. The waves are seen to pass around the barrier into the regions behind it subsequently the water behind the barrier is disturbed. The amount of diffraction (the sharpness of the bending) increases with increasing wavelength and decreases with decreasing wavelength. In fact when the wavelength of the waves are smaller than the obstacle no noticeable diffraction occurs. ,One of the most interesting and also very useful properties of Wave is Diffraction Definition: Diffraction Diffraction is the ability of Wave to spread out in wavefronts as the Wave passes through small aperture or around sharp edge.

357,357,26.5.1,Diffraction through a Slit,558,When wave strikes barrier with hole only part of the wave can move through the hole. If the hole is similar in size to the wavelength of the wave diffractions occurs. The waves that comes through the hole no longer looks like straight wave front. It bends around the edges of the hole. If the hole is small enough it acts like point source of circular waves. Now if allow the wavefront to impinge on barrier with hole in it then only the points on the wavefront that move into the hole can continue emitting forward moving waves but because lot of the wavefront have been removed the points on the edges of the hole emit waves that bend round the edges. If you employ Huygens principle you can see the effect is that the wavefronts are no longer straight lines. Each point of the slit acts like point source. If we think about the two point sources on the edges of the slit and call them and then we can go back to the diagram we had earlier but with some parts block by the wall. If this diagram were showing sound waves then the sound would be louder (constructive interference) in some places and quieter (destructive interference) in others. You can start to see that there will be pattern (interference pattern) to the louder and quieter places. If we were studying light waves then the light would be brighter in some places than others depending on the interferences. The intensity (how bright or loud) of the interference pattern for single narrow slit looks like this: The picture above shows how the waves add together to form the interference pattern. The peaks correspond to places where the waves are adding most intensely and the zeroes are places where destructive interference is taking place. When looking at interference patterns from light the spectrum looks like: There is formula we can use to determine where the peaks and minimums are in the interference spectrum. There will be more than one minimum. There are the same number of minima on either side of the central peak and the distances from the first one on each side are the same to the peak. The distances to the peak from the second minimum on each side is also the same in fact the two sides are mirror images of each other. We label the first minimum that corresponds to positive angle from the centre as and the first on the other side (a negative angle from the centre as the second set of minima are labelled and etc. The equation for the angle at which the minima occur is Definition: Interference Minima The angle at which the minima in the interference spectrum occur is: sin where is the angle to the minimum is the wavelength of the impinging wavefronts is the order of the mimimum 123 ... From the formula you can see that smaller wavelength for the same slit results in smaller angle to the interference minimum. This is something you just saw in the two worked examples. Do sanity check go back and see if the answer makes sense. Ask yourself which light had the longer wavelength which light had the larger angle and what do you expect for longer wavelengths from the formula. ,When Wave strikes barrier with hole only part of the Wave can move through the hole.

358,358,26.6,Shock Waves and Sonic Booms,562,Now we know that the waves move away from the source at the speed of sound. What happens if the source moves at the same time as emitting sounds? Once sound wave has been emitted it is no longer connected to the source so if the source moves it doesnt change the way the sound wave is propagating through the medium. This means source can actually catch up with sound waves it has emitted. The speed of sound is very fast in air about 340 s1 so if we want to talk about source catching up to sound waves then the source has to be able to move very fast. good source of sound waves to discuss is jet aircraft.

359,359,26.6.1,Subsonic Flight,563,Definition: Subsonic Subsonic refers to speeds slower than the speed of sound. When source emits sound waves and is moving but slower than the speed of sound you get the situation in this picture. Notice that the source moving means that the wavefronts and therefore peaks in the wave are actually closer together in the one direction and further apart in the other. subsonic flight If you measure the waves on the side where the peaks are closer together youll measure different wavelength than on the other side of the source. This means that the noise from the source will sound different on the different sides. This is called the Doppler Effect. Definition: Doppler Effect when the wavelength and frequency measured by an observer are different to those emitted by the source due to movement of the source or observer. ,Definition: Subsonic Subsonic refers to Speed slower than the Speed of Sound When source emits Sound Wave and is moving but slower than the Speed of Sound you get the situation in this picture.

360,360,26.6.2,Supersonic Flight,563,Definition: Supersonic Supersonic refers to speeds faster than the speed of sound. If plane flies at exactly the speed of sound then the waves that it emits in the direction it is flying wont be able to get away from the plane. It also means that the next sound wave emitted will be exactly on top of the previous one look at this picture to see what the wavefronts would look like: Sometimes we use the speed of sound as reference to describe the speed of the object (aircraft in our discussion). Definition: Mach Number The Mach Number is the ratio of the speed of an object to the speed of sound in the surrounding medium. Mach number is tells you how many times faster than sound the aircraft is moving. Mach Number aircraft moving slower than the speed of sound Mach Number aircraft moving at the speed of sound Mach Number aircraft moving faster than the speed of sound To work out the Mach Number divide the speed of the aircraft by the speed of sound. Mach Number vaircraft vsound Remember: the units must be the same before you divide. If the aircraft is moving faster than the speed of sound then the wavefronts look like this: If the source moves faster than the speed of sound cone of wave fronts is created. This is called Mach cone. From constructive interference we know that two peaks that add together form larger peak. In Mach cone many many peaks add together to form very large peak this is sound wave so the large peak is very very loud sound wave. This sounds like huge boom and we call the noise sonic boom. Definition: Sonic Boom sonic boom is the sound heard by an observer as shockwave passes. ,Definition: Supersonic Supersonic refers to Speed faster than the Speed of Sound If plane flies at exactly the Speed of Sound then the Wave that it emits in the Direction (geometry) it is flying wont be able to get away from the plane.

361,361,26.6.3,Mach Cone,566,You can see that the shape of the Mach Cone depends on the speed of the aircraft. When the Mach Number is there is no cone but as the aircraft goes faster and faster the angle of the cone gets smaller and smaller. If we go back to the supersonic picture we can work out what the angle of the cone must be. We build triangle between how far the plane has moved and how far wavefront at right angles to the direction the plane is flying has moved: An aircraft emits sound wavefront. The wavefront moves at the speed of sound 340 s1 and the aircraft moves at Mach 1.5 which is 1.5 340 510 s1. The aircraft travels faster than the wavefront. If we let the wavefront travel for time then the following diagram will apply: We know how fast the wavefront and the aircraft are moving so we know the distances that they have traveled: The angle between the cone that forms at the direction of the plane can be found from the right-angle triangle we have drawn into the figure. We know that sin opposite hypotenuse which in this figure means: sin opposite hypotenuse sin vsound vaircraft sin vsound vaircraft In this case we have used sound and aircraft but more general way of saying this is: aircraft source sound wavefront We often just write the equation as: ,You can see that the shape of the Mach Cone depends on the Speed of the aircraft.

364,364,27.2,de Broglie Wavelength,571,Einstein showed that for photon its momentum is equal to its energy divided the speed of light c: The energy of the photon can also be expressed in terms of the wavelength of the light hc where is Plancks constant. Combining these two equations we find that the the momentum of the photon is related to its wavelength hc or equivalently In 1923 Louis de Broglie proposed that this equation not only holds for photons but also holds for particles of matter. This is known as the de Broglie hypothesis Definition: De Broglie Hypothesis particle of mass moving with velocity has wavelength related to is momentum mv by mv (27.1) This wavelength is known as the de Broglie wavelength of the particle. Since the value of Plancks constant is incredibly small 6.63 1034 the wavelike nature of everyday objects is not really observable. The de Broglie hypothesis was proposed by French physicist Louis de Broglie (15 August 1892 19 March 1987) in 1923 in his PhD thesis. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1929 for this work which made him the first person to receive Nobel Prize on PhD thesis. This wavelength is considerably smaller than the diameter of proton which is approximately 1015 m. Hence the wave-like properties of this cricket ball are too small to be observed. Although the electron and cricket ball in the two previous examples are travelling at the same velocity the de Broglie wavelength of the electron is much larger than that of the cricket ball. This is because the wavelength is inversely proportional to the mass of the particle. Since the de Broglie wavelength of particle is inversely proportional to its velocity the wavelength decreases as the velocity increases. This is confirmed in the last two examples with the electrons. De Broglies hypothesis was confirmed by Davisson and Germer in 1927 when they observed beam of electrons being diffracted off nickel surface. The diffraction means that the moving electrons have wave nature. They were also able to determine the wavelength of the electrons from the diffraction. To measure wavelength one needs two or more diffacting centres such as pinholes slits or atoms. For diffraction to occur the centres must be separated by distance about the same size as the wavelength. Theoretically all objects not just sub-atomic particles exhibit wave properties according to the de Broglie hypothesis. ,Einstein showed that for photon its momentum is equal to its Energy divided the Speed of Light c: The Energy of the photon can also be expressed in terms of the Wavelength of the Light hc where is Plancks constant.

365,365,27.3,The Electron Microscope,574,We have seen that under certain circumstances particles behave like waves. This idea is used in the electron microscope which is type of microscope that uses electrons to create an image of the target. It has much higher magnification or resolving power than normal light microscope up to two million times allowing it to see smaller objects and details. Lets first review how regular optical microscope works. beam of light is shone through thin target and the image is then magnified and focused using objective and ocular lenses. The amount of light which passes through the target depends on the densities of the target since the less dens regions allow more light to pass through than the denser regions. This means that the beam of light which is partially transmitted through the target carries information about the inner structure of the target. The original form of the electron microscopy the transmission electron microscopy works in similar manner using electrons. In the electron microscope electrons which are emitted by cathode are formed into beam using magnetic lenses. This electron beam is then passed through very thin target. Again the regions in the target with higher densities stop the electrons more easily. So the amount of electrons which pass through the different regions of the target depend their densities. This means that the partially transmitted beam of electrons carries information about the densities of the inner structure of the target. The spatial variation in this information (the image) is then magnified by series of magnetic lenses and it is recorded by hitting fluorescent screen photographic plate or light sensitive sensor such as CCD (charge-coupled device) camera. The image detected by the CCD may be displayed in real time on monitor or computer. In figure ?? is an image of the polio virus obtained with transmission electron microscope. The structure of an optical and electron microscope are compared in figure 27.3. While the optical microscope uses light and focuses using lenses the electron microscope uses electrons and focuses using electromagnets. The first electron microscope prototype was built in 1931 by the German engineers Ernst Ruska and Maximillion Knoll. It was based on the ideas and discoveries of Louis de Broglie. Although it was primitive and was not ideal for practical use the instrument was still capable of magnifying objects by four hundred times. The first practical electron microscope was built at the Electron microscopes are very useful as they are able to magnify objects to much higher resolution. This is because their de Broglie wavelengths are so much smaller than that of visible light. You hopefully remember that light is diffracted by objects which are separated by distance of about the same size as the wavelength of the light. This diffraction then prevents you from being able to focus the transmitted light into an image. So the sizes at which diffraction occurs for beam of electrons is much smaller than those for visible light. This is why you can magnify targets to much higher order of magnification using electrons rather than visible light. Extension: High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope (HRTEM) There are high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) which have been built. However their resolution is limited by spherical and chromatic aberration. Fortunately though software correction of the spherical aberration has allowed the production of images with very high resolution. In fact the resolution is sufficient to show carbon atoms in diamond separated by only 89 picometers and atoms in silicon at 78 picometers. This is at magnifications of 50 million times. The ability to determine the positions of atoms within materials has made the HRTEM very useful tool for nano-technologies research. It is also very important for the development of semiconductor devices for electronics and photonics. Transmission electron microscopes produce two-dimensional images. Extension: Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) The Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) produces images by hitting the target with primary electron beam which then excites the surface of the target. This causes secondary electrons to be emitted from the surface which are then detected. So the the electron beam in the SEM is moved across the sample while detectors build an image from the secondary electrons. Generally the transmission electron microscopes resolution is about an order of magnitude better than the SEM resolution however because the SEM image relies on surface processes rather than transmission it is able to image bulk samples and has much greater depth of view and so can produce images that are good representation of the 3D structure of the sample. ,We have seen that under certain circumstances particles behave like Wave This idea is used in the Electron Optical microscope which is type of Optical microscope that uses Electron to create an image of the target.

366,366,27.3.1,Disadvantages of an Electron Microscope,577,Electron microscopes are expensive to buy and maintain. they are also very sensitive to vibration and external magnetic fields. This means that special facilities are required to house microscopes aimed at achieving high resolutions. Also the targets have to be viewed in vacuum as the electrons would scatter with the molecules that make up air. Extension: Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) Scanning electron microscopes usually image conductive or semi-conductive materials best. common preparation technique is to coat the target with several-nanometer layer of conductive material such as gold from sputtering machine however this process has the potential to disturb delicate samples. The targets have to be prepared in many ways to give proper detail which may result in artifacts purely the result of treatment. This gives the problem of distinguishing artifacts from material particularly in biological samples. Scientists maintain that the results from various preparation techniques have been compared and as there is no reason that they should all produce similar artifacts it is therefore reasonable to believe that electron microscopy features correlate with living cells.

370,370,28.2,Electrical machines - generators and motors,579,We have seen that when conductor is moved in magnetic field or when magnet is moved near conductor such that the magnetic field is not parallel to the conductor current flows in the conductor. The amount of current depends on the speed at which the conductor experiences changing magnetic field the number of turns of the conductor and the orientation of the plane of the conductor with respect to the magnetic field. The effect of the orientation of the conductor with respect to the magnetic field is shown in Figure 28.1. Figure 28.1: Series of figures showing that the magnetic flux through conductor is dependent on the angle that the plane of the conductor makes with the magnetic field. The greatest flux passes through the conductor when the plane of the conductor is perpendicular to the magnetic field lines as in (a). The number of field lines passing through the conductor decreases as the conductor rotates until it is parallel to the magnetic field. If the current flowing in the conductor were plotted as function of the angle between the plane of the conductor and the magnetic field then the current would vary as shown in Figure 28.2. The current alternates about the zero value and is also known as an alternating current (abbreviated AC).

371,371,28.2.1,Electrical generators,580,AC generator The principle of rotating conductor in magnetic field is used in electricity generators. generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. Definition: Generator generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. The layout of an AC generator is shown in Figure 28.3. The conductor in the shape of coil is connected to ring. The conductor is then manually rotated in the magnetic field generating an alternating emf. The slip rings are connected to the load via brushes. If machine is constructed to rotate magnetic field around set of stationary wire coils with the turning of shaft AC voltage will be produced across the wire coils as that shaft is rotated in accordance with Faradays Law of electromagnetic induction. This is the basic operating principle of an AC generator. In an AC generator the two ends of the coil are each attached to slip ring that makes contact with brushes as the coil turns. The direction of the current changes with every half turn of the coil. As one side of the loop moves to the other pole of the magnetic field the current in it changes direction. The two slip rings of the AC generator allow the current to change directions and become alternating current. AC generators are also known as alternators. They are found in motor cars to charge the car battery. DC generator DC generator is constructed the same way as an AC generator except that there is one slip ring which is split into two pieces called commutator so the current in the external circuit does not change direction. The layout of DC generator is shown in Figure 28.4. The split-ring commutator accommodates for the change in direction of the current in the loop thus creating DC current going through the brushes and out to the circuit. The shape of the emf from DC generator is shown in Figure 28.5. The emf is not steady but is more or less the positive halves of sine wave. AC versus DC generators The problems involved with making and breaking electrical contact with moving coil should be obvious (sparking and heat) especially if the shaft of the generator is revolving at high speed. If the atmosphere surrounding the machine contains flammable or explosive vapors the practical problems of spark-producing brush contacts are even greater. An AC generator (alternator) does not require brushes and commutators to work and so is immune to these problems experienced by DC generators. The benefits of AC over DC with regard to generator design is also reflected in electric motors. While DC motors require the use of brushes to make electrical contact with moving coils of wire AC motors do not. In fact AC and DC motor designs are very similar to their generator counterparts. The AC motor being dependent upon the reversing magnetic field produced by alternating current through its stationary coils of wire to rotate the rotating magnet around on its shaft and the DC motor being dependent on the brush contacts making and breaking connections to reverse current through the rotating coil every 12 rotation (180 degrees). ,AC generator The principle of rotating Electrical conductor in Magnet Field (physics) is used in electricity generators. generator converts Mechanical energy into electrical Energy Definition: Generator generator converts Mechanical energy into electrical Energy The layout of an AC generator is shown in Figure 28.3.

372,372,28.2.2,Electric motors,582,The basic principles of operation for motor are the same as that of generator except that motor converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. Definition: Motor An electric motor converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. Both motors and generators can be explained in terms of coil that rotates in magnetic field. In generator the coil is attached to an external circuit and it is mechanically turned resulting in changing flux that induces an emf. In motor current-carrying coil in magnetic field experiences force on both sides of the coil creating torque which makes it turn. Any coil carrying current can feel force in magnetic field the force is the Lorentz force on the moving charges in the conductor. We know that if the coil is parallel to the magnetic field then the Lorentz force will be zero. The charge of opposite sides of the coil will be in opposite directions because the charges are moving in opposite directions. This means the coil will rotate. Instead of rotating the loops through magnetic field to create electricity current is sent through the wires creating electromagnets. The outer magnets will then repel the electromagnets and rotate the shaft as an electric motor. If the current is AC the two slip rings are required to create an AC motor. An AC motor is shown in Figure 28.6 If the current is DC split-ring commutators are required to create DC motor.

374,374,28.3,Alternating Current,585,Most students of electricity begin their study with what is known as direct current (DC) which is electricity flowing in constant direction. DC is the kind of electricity made by battery with definite positive and negative terminals). However we have seen that the electricity produced by generator alternates and is therefore known as alternating current(AC). The main advantage to AC is that the voltage can be changed using transformers. That means that the voltage can be stepped up at power stations to very high voltage so that electrical energy can be transmitted along power lines at low current and therefore experience low energy loss due to heating. The voltage can then be stepped down for use in buildings and street lights. In South Africa alternating current is generated at frequency of 50 Hz. The circuit symbol for alternating current is: Graphs of voltage against time and current against time for an AC circuit are shown in Figure 28.9 In DC circuit the current and voltage are constant. In an AC circuit the current and voltage vary with time. The value of the current or voltage at any specific moment in time is called the instantaneous current or voltage and is calculated as follows: Imaxsin(2ft) Vmaxsin(2ft) is the instantaneous current. Imax is the maximum current. is the instantaneous voltage. Vmax is the maximum voltage. is the frequency of the AC and is the time at which the instantaneous current or voltage is being calculated. This average value we use for AC is known as the root mean square (rms) average. This is defined as: Since AC varies sinusoidally with as much positive as negative doing straight average would get you zero for the average voltage. The rms value by-passes this problem. ,Most students of electricity begin their study with what is known as Direction (geometry) Electric current (DC) which is electricity flowing in constant Direction (geometry) DC is the kind of electricity made by battery with definite Position (vector) and negative terminals).

377,377,28.4.2,Inductance,586,An inductor is passive electrical device used in electrical circuits for its property of inductance. An inductor is usually made as coil (or solenoid) of conducting material typically copper wire wrapped around core either of air or of ferromagnetic material. Electrical current through the conductor creates magnetic flux proportional to the current. change in this current creates change in magnetic flux that in turn generates an emf that acts to oppose this change in current. Inductance (measured in henries symbol H) is measure of the generated emf for unit change in current. For example an inductor with an inductance of produces an emf of when the current through the inductor changes at the rate of As1. The inductance of an inductor is determined by several factors: the shape of the coil short fat coil has higher inductance than one that is thin and tall. the material that conductor is wrapped around. how the conductor is wound winding in opposite directions will cancel out the inductance effect and you will have only resistor. The inductance of solenoid is defined by: 0AN2 where is the permeability of the core material (in this case air) is the cross-sectional area of the solenoid is the number of turns and is the length of the solenoid. Definition: Permeability Permeability is the property of material which describes the magnetisation developed in that material when excited by source. The permeability of free space is 4x107 henry per metre. An inductor in an AC circuit also has reactance XL that is defined by: XL 2fL where is the inductance and is the frequency of the AC. If we examine the equation for the reactance of an inductor we see that inductive reactance increases with increasing frequency. Therefore when the frequency is low the inductive reactance is very low. This is why an inductor allows the flow of DC and low frequency AC because its reactance decreases with decreasing frequency.

380,380,29.2,Capacitive and Inductive Circuits,591,Earlier in Grade 12 you were shown alternating currents (a.c.) and you saw that the voltage and the current varied with time. If the a.c. supply is connected to resistor then the current and voltage will be proportional to each other. This means that the current and voltage will peak at the same time. We say that the current and voltage are in phase. This is shown in Figure 29.1. When capacitor is connected to an alternating voltage the maximum voltage is proportional to the maximum current but the maximum voltage does not occur at the same time as the maximum current. The current has its maximum (it peaks) one quarter of cycle before the voltage peaks. Engineers say that the current leads the voltage by 90. This is shown in Figure 29.2. For circuit with capacitor the instantaneous value of is not constant. However the value of Vmax Imax is useful and is called the capacitive reactance (XC) of the component. Because it is still voltage divided by current (like resistance) its unit is the ohm. The value of XC (C Inductors are very similar but the current peaks 90 after the voltage. This is shown in Figure 29.3. Engineers say that the current lags the voltage. Again the ratio of maximum voltage to maximum current is called the reactance this time inductive reactance (XL). The value of the reactance depends on its inductance (L). Definition: Reactance The ratio of the maximum voltage to the maximum current when capacitor or inductor is connected to an alternating voltage. The unit of reactance is the ohm. While inductive and capacitive reactances are similar in one sense they are opposites. For an inductor the current peaks 90 after the voltage. For capacitor the current peaks 90 ahead of the voltage. When we work out the total reactance for an inductor and capacitor in series we use the formula to take this into account. This formula can also be used when there is more than one inductor or more than one capacitor in the circuit. The total reactance is the sum of all of the inductive reactances minus the sum of all the capacitive reactances. The magnitude (number) in the final result gives the ratio of maximum voltage to maximum current in the circuit as whole. The sign of the final result tells you its phase. If it is positive the current peaks 90 after the voltage if it is negative the current peaks 90 before the voltage. If series circuit contains resistors as well then the situation is more complicated. The maximum current is still proportional to the maximum voltage but the phase difference between them wont be 90. The ratio between the maximum voltage and maximum current is called the impedance (Z) and its unit is also the ohm. Impedances are calculated using this formula: X2 R2 (29.4) where is the total reactance of the inductors and capacitors in the circuit and is the total resistance of the resistors in the circuit. It is easier to understand this formula by thinking of right angled triangle. Resistances are drawn horizontally reactances are drawn vertically. The hypotenuse of the triangle gives the impedance. This is shown in Figure 29.4. Definition: Impedance The maximum voltage divided by the maximum current for any circuit. The unit of impedance is the ohm. It is important to remember that when resistors and inductances (or capacitors) are in circuit the current will not be in phase with the voltage so the impedance is not resistance. Similarly the current wont be exactly 90 out of phase with the voltage so the impedance isnt reactance either. Most factories containing heavy duty electrical equipment (e.g. large motors) have to pay extra money to their electricity supply company because the inductance of the motor coils causes the current and voltage to get out of phase. As this makes the electricity distribution network less efficient financial penalty is incurred. The factory engineer can prevent this by connecting capacitors into the circuit to reduce the reactance to zero as in the last question above. The current and voltage are then in phase again. We cant calculate the capacitance needed in this chapter because the capacitors are usually connected in parallel and we have only covered the reactances and impedances of series circuits. ,Earlier in Grade 12 you were shown alternating Electric current (a.c.) and you saw that the Voltage and the Electric current varied with time.

382,382,29.3.1,Capacitors and Inductors as Filters,596,We have already seen how capacitors and inductors pass current more easily at certain frequencies than others. To recap: if we examine the equation for the reactance of capacitor we see that the frequency is in the denominator. Therefore when the frequency is low the capacitive reactance is very high. This is why capacitor blocks the flow of DC and low frequency AC because its reactance increases with decreasing frequency. When the frequency is high the capacitive reactance is low. This is why capacitor allows the flow of high frequency AC because its reactance decreases with increasing frequency. Therefore putting capacitor in circuit blocks the low frequencies and allows the high frequencies to pass. This is called high pass filter. filter like this can be used in the treble setting of sound mixer or music player which controls the amount of high frequency signal reaching the speaker. The more high frequency signal there is the tinnier the sound. simple high pass filter circuit is shown in Figure 29.5.

The more low frequency signal there is the more the sound booms. simple low pass filter circuit is shown in Figure 29.6. Figure 29.5: high pass filter. High frequencies easily pass through the capacitor and into the next part of the circuit while low frequencies pass through the inductor straight to ground. ,We have already seen how Capacitor and inductors pass Electric current more easily at certain Frequency than others.

383,383,29.3.2,"LRC Circuits, Resonance and Signal Tuning",596,circuit containing resistor capacitor and an inductor all in series is called an LRC circuit. Because the components are in series the current through each component at particular time will be the same as the current through the others. The voltage across the resistor will be in phase with the current. The voltage across the inductor will be 90 ahead of the current (the current always follows or lags the voltage in an inductor). The voltage across the capacitor will be 90 behind the current (the current leads the voltage for capacitor). The phases of the three voltages are shown in Figure 29.7. Figure 29.6: low pass filter. Low frequencies pass through the inductor and into the next part of the circuit while high frequencies pass through the capacitor straight to ground. Figure 29.7: The voltages across the separate components of an LRC circuit. Looking at the peaks you see that the voltage across the inductor VL peaks first followed 90 later by the current followed 90 later by the voltage across the capacitor VC. The voltage across the resistor is not shown it is in phase with the current and peaks at the same time as the current. 59 The reactance of the inductor is 2fL and the reactance of the capacitor is 12fC but with the opposite phase. So the total reactance of the LRC circuit is XL XC 2fL 2fC The impedance of the circuit as whole is given by X2 R2 2fL 2fC R2 At different frequencies the impedance will take different values. The impedance will have its smallest value when the positive inductive reactance cancels out the negative capacitive reactance. This occurs when 2fL 2fC so the frequency of minimum impedance must be 2LC This is called the resonant frequency of the circuit. This is the frequency at which you can get the largest current for particular supply voltage. It is also called the natural frequency of the circuit. This means the frequency at which the circuit would oscillate by itself. Definition: Resonance Resonance occurs when circuit is connected to an alternating voltage at its natural fre- quency. very large current in the circuit can build up even with minimal power input. An LRC circuit is very useful when we have signal containing many different frequencies and we only want one of them. If signal like this is connected to an LRC circuit then only the resonant frequency (and other frequencies close to it) will drive measureable currents. This means that an LRC circuit can select one frequency from range. This process is called signal tuning. When you set up radio antenna and amplify the radio signal it receives you find many different bands of frequencies one from each radio station. When you listen to the radio you only want to listen to one station. An LRC circuit in the radio (the tuning circuit) is set so that its resonant frequency is the frequency of the station you want to listen to. This means that of the many radio stations broadcasting you only hear one. When you adjust the tuning dial on the radio it changes the capacitance of the capacitor in the tuning circuit. This changes the resonant frequency and this changes the radio station that you will hear. ,circuit containing resistor Capacitor and an inductor all in series is called an LRC circuit.

385,385,29.4.1,The Diode,599,diode is an electronic device that allows current to flow in one direction only. diode consists of two doped semi-conductors joined together so that the resistance is low when connected one way and very high the other way. Figure 29.9: Operation of diode. (a) The diode is forward biased and current is permitted. The negative terminal of the battery is connected to the negative terminal of the diode. (b) The diode is reverse biased and current flow is not allowed. The negative terminal of the battery is connected to the positive terminal of the diode. full explanation of diode operation is complex. Here is simplified description. The diode consists of two semiconductor blocks attached together. Neither block is made of pure silicon they are both doped. Doping was described in more detail in Section 10.3. In short p-type semiconductor has fewer free electrons than normal semiconductor. stands for positive meaning lack of electrons although the material is actually neutral. The locations where electrons are missing are called holes. This material can conduct electricity well because electrons can move into the holes making new hole somewhere else in the material. Any extra electrons introduced into this region by the circuit will fill some or all of the holes. In n-type semiconductor the situation is reversed. The material has an more free electrons than normal semiconductor. stands for negative meaning an excess of electrons although the material is actually neutral. When p-type semiconductor is attached to an n-type semiconductor some of the free electrons in the n-type move across to the p-type semiconductor. They fill the available holes near the junction. This means that the region of the n-type semiconductor nearest the junction has no free electrons (theyve moved across to fill the holes). This makes this n-type semiconductor positively charged. It used to be electrically neutral but has since lost electrons. The region of p-type semiconductor nearest the junction now has no holes (theyve been filled in by the migrating electrons). This makes the p-type semiconductor negatively charged. It used to be electrically neutral but has since gained electrons. Without free electrons or holes the central region can not conduct electricity well. It has high resistance and is called the depletion band. This is shown in Figure 29.10. You can explain the high resistance in different way. free electron in the n-type semiconductor will be repelled from the p-type semiconductor because of its negative charge. The electron will not go into the depletion band and certainly wont cross the band to the p-type semiconductor. You may ask But wont free electron in the p-type semiconductor be attracted across the band carrying current? But there are no free electrons in p-type semiconductor so no current of this kind can flow. If the diode is reverse-biased the terminal of the battery is connected to the n-type semiconductor. This makes it even more negatively charged. It also removes even more of the free electrons near the depletion band. At the same time the terminal of the battery is connected to the p-type silicon. This will supply free electrons and fill in more of the holes next to the depletion band. Both processes cause the depletion band to get wider. The resistance of the diode (which was already high) increases. This is why reverse-biased diode does not conduct. Another explanation for the increased resistance is that the battery has made the p-type semiconductor more negative than it used to be making it repel any electrons from the n-type semiconductor which attempt to cross the depletion band. On the other hand if the diode is forward biased the depletion band is made narrower. The negative charge on the p-type silicon is cancelled out by the battery. The greater the voltage used the narrower the depletion band becomes. Eventually when the voltage is about 06 (for silicon) the depletion band disappears. Once this has occurred the diode conducts very well.

In short p-type semiconductor has fewer free Electron than normal semiconductor. stands for Position (vector) meaning lack of Electron although the material is actually neutral. The locations where Electron are missing are called holes. This material can conduct electricity well because Electron can move into the holes making new hole somewhere else in the material.

The material has an more free Electron than normal semiconductor. stands for negative meaning an excess of Electron although the material is actually neutral. When p-type semiconductor is attached to an n-type semiconductor some of the free Electron in the n-type move across to the p-type semiconductor. They fill the available holes near the junction. This means that the region of the n-type semiconductor nearest the junction has no free Electron (theyve moved across to fill the holes).

386,386,29.4.2,The Light Emitting Diode (LED),601,light-emitting diode (LED) is diode device that emits light when charge flows in the correct direction through it. If you apply voltage to force current to flow in the direction the LED allows it will light up. Extension: Circuit Symbols This notation of having two small arrows pointing away from the device is common to the schematic symbols of all light-emitting semiconductor devices. Conversely if device is light-activated (meaning that incoming light stimulates it) then the symbol will have two small arrows pointing toward it.

387,387,29.4.3,Transistor,603,The diode is the simplest semiconductor device made up of p-type semiconductor and an n-type semiconductor in contact. It can conduct in only one direction but it cannot control the size of an electric current. Transistors are more complicated electronic components which can control the size of the electric current flowing through them. This enables them to be used in amplifiers. small signal from microphone or radio antenna can be used to control the transistor. In response the transistor will then increase and decrease much larger current which flows through the speakers. One of the earliest popular uses of transistors was in cheap and portable radios. Before that radios were much more expensive and contained glass valves which were fragile and needed replacing. In some parts of the world you can still hear people talking about their transistor they mean their portable radio. You can also use small current to turn the transistor on and off. The transistor then controls more complicated or powerful current through other components. When transistor is used in this way it is said to be in switching mode as it is acting as remotely controlled switch. As we shall see in the final sections of this chapter switching circuits can be used in computer to process and store digital information. computer would not work without the millions (or billions) of transistors in it. There are two main types of transistor bipolar transistors (NPN or PNP) and field effect transistors (FETs). Both use doped semiconductors but in different ways. You are mainly required to know about field effect transistors (FETs) however we have to give brief description of bipolar transistors so that you see the difference. Bipolar Transistors Bipolar transistors are made of doped semiconductor sandwich. In an NPN transistor very thin layer of p-type semiconductor is in between two thicker layers of n-type semiconductor. This is shown in Figure 29.11. Similarly an PNP transistor consists of very thin n-type layer in between two thicker layers of p-type semiconductor. In an NPN transistor small current of electrons flows from the emitter (E) to the base (B). Simultaneously much larger current of electrons flows from the emitter (E) to the collector (C). If you lower the number of electrons able to leave the transistor at the base (B) the transistor automatically reduces the number of electrons flowing from emitter (E) to collector (C). Similarly if you increase the current of electrons flowing out of the base (B) the transistor automatically also increases the current of electrons flowing from emitter (E) to collector (C). The transistor is designed so that the current of electrons from emitter to collector (IEC) is proportional to the current of electrons from emitter to base (IEB). The constant of proportionality is known as the current gain So IEC IEB. How does it do it? The answer comes from our work with diodes. Electrons arriving at the emitter (n-type semiconductor) will naturally flow through into the central p-type since the base-emitter junction is forward biased. However if none of these electrons are removed from the base the electrons flowing into the base from the emitter will fill all of the available holes. Accordingly large depletion band will be set up. This will act as an insulator preventing current flow into the collector as well. On the other hand if the base is connected to positive voltage small number of electrons will be removed by the base connection. This will prevent the holes in the base becoming filled up and no depletion band will form. While some electrons from the emitter leave via the base connection the bulk of them flow straight on to the collector. You may wonder how the electrons get from the base into the collector (it seems to be reverse biased). The answer is complicated but the important fact is that the p-type layer is extremely thin. As long as there is no depletion layer the bulk of the electrons will have no difficulty passing straight from the n-type emitter into the n-type collector. more satisfactory answer can be given to university student once band theory has been explained. Summing up in an NPN transistor small flow of electrons from emitter (E) to base (B) allows much larger flow of electrons from emitter (E) to collector (C). Given that conventional current (flowing from to is in the opposite direction to electron flow we say that small conventional current from base to emitter allows large current to flow from collector to emitter. PNP transistor works the other way. small conventional current from emitter to base allows much larger conventional current to flow from emitter to collector. The operation is more complicated to explain since the principal charge carrier in PNP transistor is not the electron but the hole. The operation of NPN and PNP transistors (in terms of conventional currents) is summarized in Figure 29.12. The transistor is considered by many to be one of the greatest discoveries or inventions in modern history ranking with banking and the printing press. Key to the importance of the transistor in modern society is its ability to be produced in huge numbers using simple techniques resulting in vanishingly small prices. Computer chips consist of millions of transistors and sell for Rands with per-transistor costs in the thousandths-of-cents. The low cost has meant that the transistor has become an almost universal tool for non-mechanical tasks. Whereas common device say refrigerator would have used mechanical device for control today it is often less expensive to simply use few million transistors and the appropriate computer program to carry out the same task through brute force. Today transistors have replaced almost all electromechanical devices most simple feedback systems and appear in huge numbers in everything from computers to cars. The transistor was invented at Bell Laboratories in December 1947 (first demonstrated on December 23) by John Bardeen Walter Houser Brattain and William Bradford Shockley who were awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1956. The Field Effect Transistor (FET) To control bipolar transistors you control the current flowing into or out of its base. The other type of transistor is the field effect transistor (FET). FETs work using control voltages instead. Accordingly they can be controlled with much smaller currents and are much more economic to use. No-one would build computer with billions of bipolar transistors the current in each transistors base might be small but when you add up all of the base currents in the millions of transistors the computer as whole would be consuming great deal of electricity and making great deal of heat. Not only is this wasteful it would prevent manufacturers making computer of convenient size. If the transistors were too close together they would overheat. Figure 29.13: field effect transistor (FET). The diagram on the left shows the semiconductor structure. The diagram on the right shows its circuit symbol. The three terminals of the FET are called the source (S) drain (D) and gate (G) as shown in Figure 29.13. When the gate is not connected current of electrons can flow from source (S) to drain (D) easily along the channel. The source is accordingly the negative terminal of the transistor. The drain where the electrons come out is the positive terminal of the transistor. few electrons will flow from the n-type channel into the p-type semiconductor of the gate when the device is manufactured. However as these electrons are not removed (the gate is not connected) depletion band is set up which prevents further flow into the gate. In operation the gate is connected to negative voltages relative to the source. This makes the p-n junction between gate and channel reverse-biased. Accordingly no current flows from the source into the gate. When the voltage of the gate is lowered (made more negative) the depletion band becomes wider. This enlarged depletion band takes up some of the space of the channel. So the lower the voltage of the gate (the more negative it is relative to the source) the larger the depletion band. The larger the depletion band the narrower the channel. The narrower the channel the harder it is for electrons to flow from source to drain. The voltage of the gate is not the only factor affecting the current of electrons between the source and the drain. If the external circuit has low resistance electrons are able to leave the drain easily. If the external circuit has high resistance electrons leave the drain slowly. This creates kind of traffic jam which slows the passage of further electrons. In this way the voltage of the drain regulates itself and is more or less independent of the current demanded from the drain. Once these two factors have been taken into account it is fair to say that the positive output voltage (the voltage of the drain relative to the source) is proportional to the negative input voltage (the voltage of the gate relative to the source). For this reason the field effect transistor is known as voltage amplifier. This contrasts with the bipolar transistor which is current amplifier. ,The diode is the simplest semiconductor device made up of p-type semiconductor and an n-type semiconductor in contact. It can conduct in only one Direction (geometry) but it cannot control the size of an electric Electric current Transistors are more complicated Electron components which can control the size of the electric Electric current flowing through them.

Whereas common device say refrigerator would have used mechanical device for control today it is often less expensive to simply use few million transistors and the appropriate computer program to carry out the same task through brute Force Today transistors have replaced almost all electromechanical devices most simple feedback systems and appear in huge numbers in everything from computers to cars. The transistor was invented at Bell Laboratories in December 1947 (first demonstrated on December 23) by John Bardeen Walter Houser Brattain and William Bradford Shockley who were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1956. The Field (physics) Effect Transistor (FET) To control bipolar transistors you control the Electric current flowing into or out of its base. The other type of transistor is the Field (physics) effect transistor (FET). FETs Work (physics) using control Voltage instead. Accordingly they can be controlled with much smaller Electric current and are much more economic to use. No-one would build computer with billions of bipolar transistors the Electric current in each transistors base might be small but when you add up all of the base Electric current in the millions of transistors the computer as whole would be consuming great deal of electricity and making great deal of heat. Not only is this wasteful it would prevent manufacturers making computer of convenient size. If the transistors were too close together they would overheat. Figure 29.13: Field (physics) effect transistor (FET). The diagram on the left shows the semiconductor structure. The diagram on the right shows its circuit symbol. The three terminals of the FET are called the source (S) drain (D) and gate (G) as shown in Figure 29.13. When the gate is not connected Electric current of Electron can flow from source (S) to drain (D) easily along the channel. The source is accordingly the negative terminal of the transistor. The drain where the Electron come out is the Position (vector) terminal of the transistor. few Electron will flow from the n-type channel into the p-type semiconductor of the gate when the device is manufactured. However as these Electron are not removed (the gate is not connected) depletion band is set up which prevents further flow into the gate. In operation the gate is connected to negative Voltage relative to the source. This makes the p-n junction between gate and channel reverse-biased. Accordingly no Electric current flows from the source into the gate. When the Voltage of the gate is lowered (made more negative) the depletion band becomes wider. This enlarged depletion band takes up some of the space of the channel. So the lower the Voltage of the gate (the more negative it is relative to the source) the larger the depletion band. The larger the depletion band the narrower the channel. The narrower the channel the harder it is for Electron to flow from source to drain. The Voltage of the gate is not the only factor affecting the Electric current of Electron between the source and the drain. If the external circuit has low Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance Electron are able to leave the drain easily. If the external circuit has high Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance Electron leave the drain slowly. This creates kind of traffic jam which slows the passage of further Electron In this way the Voltage of the drain regulates itself and is more or less independent of the Electric current demanded from the drain. Once these two factors have been taken into account it is fair to say that the Position (vector) output Voltage (the Voltage of the drain relative to the source) is proportional to the negative input Voltage (the Voltage of the gate relative to the source). For this reason the Field (physics) effect transistor is known as Voltage amplifier. This contrasts with the bipolar transistor which is Electric current amplifier. ,The diode is the simplest semiconductor device made up of p-type semiconductor and an n-type semiconductor in contact. It can conduct in only one <b>Direction (geometry)</b> but it cannot control the size of an electric <b>Electric current</b> Transistors are more complicated <b>Electron</b> components which can control the size of the electric <b>Electric current</b> flowing through them. This enables them to be used in amplifiers. small signal from microphone or radio antenna can be used to control the transistor. In response the transistor will then increase and decrease much larger <b>Electric current</b> which flows through the speakers. One of the earliest popular uses of transistors was in cheap and portable radios. Before that radios were much more expensive and contained glass valves which were fragile and needed replacing. In some parts of the world you can still hear people talking about their transistor they mean their portable radio. You can also use small <b>Electric current</b> to turn the transistor on and off. The transistor then controls more complicated or <b>Power (physics)</b> <b>Electric current</b> through other components. When transistor is used in this way it is said to be in switching mode as it is acting as remotely controlled switch. As we shall see in the final sections of this chapter switching circuits can be used in computer to process and store digital information. computer would not <b>Work (physics)</b> without the millions (or billions) of transistors in it. There are two main types of transistor bipolar transistors (NPN or PNP) and <b>Field (physics)</b> effect transistors (FETs). Both use doped semiconductors but in different ways. You are mainly required to know about <b>Field (physics)</b> effect transistors (FETs) however we have to give brief description of bipolar transistors so that you see the difference. Bipolar Transistors Bipolar transistors are made of doped semiconductor sandwich. In an NPN transistor very thin layer of p-type semiconductor is in between two thicker layers of n-type semiconductor. This is shown in Figure 29.11. Similarly an PNP transistor consists of very thin n-type layer in between two thicker layers of p-type semiconductor. In an NPN transistor small <b>Electric current</b> of <b>Electron</b> flows from the emitter (E) to the base (B). Simultaneously much larger <b>Electric current</b> of <b>Electron</b> flows from the emitter (E) to the collector (C). If you lower the number of <b>Electron</b> able to leave the transistor at the base (B) the transistor automatically reduces the number of <b>Electron</b> flowing from emitter (E) to collector (C). Similarly if you increase the <b>Electric current</b> of <b>Electron</b> flowing out of the base (B) the transistor automatically also increases the <b>Electric current</b> of <b>Electron</b> flowing from emitter (E) to collector (C). The transistor is designed so that the <b>Electric current</b> of <b>Electron</b> from emitter to collector (IEC) is proportional to the <b>Electric current</b> of <b>Electron</b> from emitter to base (IEB). The constant of proportionality is known as the <b>Electric current</b> gain So IEC IEB. How does it do it? The answer comes from our <b>Work (physics)</b> with diodes. <b>Electron</b> arriving at the emitter (n-type semiconductor) will naturally flow through into the central p-type since the base-emitter junction is forward biased. However if none of these <b>Electron</b> are removed from the base the <b>Electron</b> flowing into the base from the emitter will fill all of the available holes. Accordingly large depletion band will be set up. This will act as an <b>Insulator (electricity)</b> preventing <b>Electric current</b> flow into the collector as well. On the other hand if the base is connected to <b>Position (vector)</b> <b>Voltage</b> small number of <b>Electron</b> will be removed by the base connection. This will prevent the holes in the base becoming filled up and no depletion band will form. While some <b>Electron</b> from the emitter leave via the base connection the bulk of them flow straight on to the collector. You may wonder how the <b>Electron</b> get from the base into the collector (it seems to be reverse biased). The answer is complicated but the important fact is that the p-type layer is extremely thin. As long as there is no depletion layer the bulk of the <b>Electron</b> will have no difficulty passing straight from the n-type emitter into the n-type collector. more satisfactory answer can be given to university student once band theory has been explained. Summing up in an NPN transistor small flow of <b>Electron</b> from emitter (E) to base (B) allows much larger flow of <b>Electron</b> from emitter (E) to collector (C). Given that conventional <b>Electric current</b> (flowing from to is in the opposite <b>Direction (geometry)</b> to <b>Electron</b> flow we say that small conventional <b>Electric current</b> from base to emitter allows large <b>Electric current</b> to flow from collector to emitter. PNP transistor <b>Work (physics)</b> the other way. small conventional <b>Electric current</b> from emitter to base allows much larger conventional <b>Electric current</b> to flow from emitter to collector. The operation is more complicated to explain since the principal <b>Electric charge</b> carrier in PNP transistor is not the <b>Electron</b> but the hole. The operation of NPN and PNP transistors (in terms of conventional <b>Electric current</b> is summarized in Figure 29.12. The transistor is considered by many to be one of the greatest discoveries or inventions in modern history ranking with banking and the printing press. Key to the importance of the transistor in modern society is its ability to be produced in huge numbers using simple techniques resulting in vanishingly small prices. Computer chips consist of millions of transistors and sell for Rands with per-transistor costs in the thousandths-of-cents.

388,388,29.4.4,The Operational Amplifier,607,The operational amplifier is special kind of voltage amplifier which is made from handful of bipolar or field effect transistors. Operational amplifiers are usually called op-amps for short. They are used extensively in all kinds of audio equipment (amplifiers mixers and so on) and in instrumentation. They also have many other uses in other circuit for example comparing voltages from sensors. Operational amplifiers are supplied on Integrated Circuits (I.C.s). The most famous operational amplifier I.C. is numbered 741 and contains single operational amplifier on an integrated circuit (chip) with eight terminals. Other varieties can be bought and you can get single integrated circuit with two or four 741-type operational amplifiers on it. The symbol for an op-amp is shown in Figure 29.14. The operational amplifier has two input terminals and one output terminal. The voltage of the output terminal is proportional to the difference in voltage between the two input terminals. The output terminal is on the right (at the sharp point of the triangle). The two input terminals are drawn on the left. One input terminal (labelled with on diagrams) is called the non-inverting input. The other input terminal (labelled is called the inverting input. The labels and have nothing to do with the way in which the operational amplifier is connected to the power supply. Operational amplifiers must be connected to the power supply but this is taken for granted when circuit diagrams are drawn and these connections are not shown on circuit diagrams. Usually when drawing electronic circuits 0V is taken to mean the negative terminal of the power supply. This is not the case with op-amps. For an op-amp 0V refers to the voltage midway between the and of the supply. The output voltage of the amplifier Vout is given by the formula here is constant called the open loop gain and V+ and are the voltages of the two input terminals. That said the output voltage can not be less than the voltage of the negative terminal of the battery supplying it or higher than the positive terminal of the battery supplying it. You will notice that Vout is positive if V+ and negative if V+ V. This is why the input is called the inverting input: raising its voltage causes the output voltage to drop. The input resistance of an operational amplifier is very high. This means that very little current flows into the input terminals during operation. If all of the transistors in the operational amplifier were identical then the output voltage would be zero if the two inputs were at equal voltages. In practice this is not quite the case and for sensitive work trimming potentiometer is connected. This is adjusted until the op-amp is zeroed correctly. Simple operational amplifiers require the trimming potentiometer to be built into the circuit containing them and an example is shown in Figure 29.15. Other operational amplifier designs incorporate separate terminals for the trimming potentiometer. These special terminals are labelled offset on the manufacturers diagram. The exact method of connecting the potentiometer to the offset terminals can depend on the design of the operational amplifier and you need to refer to the manufacturers data sheet for details of which potentiometer to use and how to connect it. For most commercially produced operational amplifiers (known as op-amps for short) the open loop gain is very large and does not stay constant. Values of 100 000 are typical. Usually designer would want an amplifier with stable gain of smaller value and builds the operational amplifier into circuit like the one in Figure 29.15. ,The operational amplifier is special kind of Voltage amplifier which is made from handful of bipolar or Field (physics) effect transistors.

389,389,29.5,The Principles of Digital Electronics,609,The circuits and components we have discussed are very useful. You can build radio or television with them. You can make telephone. Even if that was all there was to electronics it would still be very useful. However the great breakthrough in the last fifty years or so has been in digital electronics. This is the subject which gave us the computer. The computer has revolutionized the way business engineering and science are done. Small computers programmed to do specific job (called microprocessors) are now used in almost every electronic machine from cars to washing machines. Computers have also changed the way we communicate. We used to have telegraph or telephone wires passing up and down country each one carrying one telephone call or signal. We now have optic fibres each capable of carrying tens of thousands of telephone calls using digital signals. So what is digital signal? Look at Figure 29.16. normal signal called an analogue signal carries smooth wave. At any time the voltage of the signal could take any value. It could be 200 or 353 or anything else. digital signal can only take certain voltages. The simplest case is shown in the figure the voltage takes one of two values. It is either high or it is low. It never has any other value. These two special voltages are given symbols. The low voltage level is written while the high voltage level is written as 1. When you send digital signal you set the voltage you want (0 or 1) then keep this fixed for fixed amount of time (for example 0.01 s) then you send the next or 1. The digital signal in Figure 29.16 could be written 01100101. Why are digital signals so good? Figure 29.16: The difference between normal (analogue) signals and digital signals. The analogue signal is on the left. 1. Using computer any information can be turned into pattern of 0s and 1s. Pictures recorded music text and motion pictures can all be turned into string of 0s and 1s and transmitted or stored in the same way. The computer receiving the signal at the other end converts it back again. Compact Disc (CD) for example can store music or text or pictures and all can be read using computer. 2. The and the look very different. You can immediately tell if or is being sent. Even if there is interference you can still tell whether the sender sent or 1. This means that fewer mistakes are made when reading digital signal. This is why the best music recording technologies and the most modern cameras for example all use digital technology. 3. Using the 0s and 1s you can count and do all kinds of mathematics. This will be explained in more detail in the next section. The simplest digital circuits are called logic gates. Each logic gate makes decision based on the information it receives. Different logic gates are set up to make the decisions in different ways.

390,390,29.5.1,Logic Gates,610,There are five main types of logic gate: NOT AND OR NAND and NOR. Each one makes its decision in different way. The NOT Gate Problem: You want an automatic circuit in your office to turn on the heating in the winter. You already have digital electronic temperature sensor. When the temperature is high it sends out 1. When the office is cold it sends out 0. If this signal were sent straight to the heater the heater would turn on (1) when it was already hot and would stay off when it was cold. This is wrong To make the heater work we need circuit which will change (from the sensor) into (to send to the heater). This will make the heater come on when it is cold. You also want it to change (from the sensor) into (to send to the heater). This will turn the heater off when the room is hot. This circuit is called an inverter or NOT gate. It changes into (1 is NOT 0). It changes into (0 is NOT 1). It changes signal into what it is NOT. The symbol for the NOT gate is: The action of the NOT gate is written in table called truth table. The left column shows the possible inputs on different rows. The right column shows what the output (decision) of the circuit will be for that input. The truth table for the NOT gate is shown below. When you read the truth table the top row says If the input is the output will be 1. For our heater this means If the room is cold the heater will turn on. The bottom row says If the input is the output will be 0. For our heater this means If the room is hot the heater will switch off. The AND Gate Problem: An airliner has two toilets. Passengers get annoyed if they get up from their seat only to find that both toilets are being used and they have to go back to their seat and wait. You want to fit an automatic circuit to light up display if both toilets are in use. Then passengers know that if the light is off there will be free toilet for them to use. There is sensor in each toilet. It gives out of the toilet is free and if it is in use. You want to send to the display unit if both sensors are sending 1s. To do this you use an AND gate. The symbol for the AND gate is: The truth table for the AND gate is shown below. An AND gate has two inputs (the NOT gate only had one). This means we need four rows in the truth table one for each possible set of inputs. The first row for example tells us what the AND gate will do if both inputs are 0. In our airliner this means that both toilets are free. The right column has showing that the output will be so the display will not light up. The second row has inputs of and (the first toilet is free the other is in use). Again the output is 0. The third row tells us what will happen if the inputs are and (the first toilet is in use and the second is free). Finally the last line tells us what will happen if both inputs are (both toilets are in use). It is only in this case that the output is and the display lights up. This device is called an AND gate because the output is only if one input AND the other input are both 1. Extension: Using and to mean True and False When we use logic gates we use the low voltage state to represent false. The high voltage state represents true. This is why the word AND is so appropriate. AND is true (1) if and only if is true (1) AND is true (1). Extension: AND and multiplication Sometimes the AND operation is written as multiplication. AND is written AB. If either or are then AB will also be 0. For AB to be we need and to both be 1. Multiplication of the numbers and does exactly the same job as an AND gate. The NAND Gate Problem: You build the circuit for the airliner toilets using an AND gate. Your customer is pleased but she says that it would be better if the display lit up when there was free toilet. In other words the display should light up unless both toilets are in use. To do this we want circuit which does the opposite of an AND gate. We want circuit which would give the output if an AND gate would give 1. We want circuit which would give the output if an AND gate would give 0. This circuit is called NAND gate. The symbol for the NAND gate is: You may have noticed that we could have done this job on the airliner by using our earlier circuit with NOT gate added between the original AND gate and the display. This is where the word NAND comes from it is short for NotAND. The OR Gate Problem: long dark corridor has two light switches one at each end of the corridor. The switches each send an output of to the control unit if no-one has pressed the switch. If someone presses the switch its output is 1. The lights in the corridor should come on if either switch is pressed. To do this job the control unit needs an OR gate. The symbol for the OR gate is: The truth table for the OR gate is shown. You can see that the output is (and the lights come on in the corridor) if either one switch OR the other is pressed. Pressing both switches also turns on the lights as the last row in the table shows. Extension: OR and addition Sometimes you will see OR written mathematically as A+B. This makes sense since if A0 and B0 then OR A+B 0. Similarly if A0 and B1 then OR A+B 1. If A1 and B0 then OR A+B once again. The only case where the OR function differs from normal addition is when A1 and B1. Here OR in logic but A+B2 in arithmetic. However there is no such thing as in logic so we define to mean OR and write 1+11 with impunity If you wish you can prove that the normal rules of algebra still work using this notation: A+(B+C) (A+B)+C A(BC) (AB)C and A(B+C) AB AC. This special kind of algebra where variables can only be (representing false) or (representing true) is called Boolean algebra. The NOR Gate The last gate you need to know is the NOR gate. This is opposite to the OR gate. The output is if both inputs are 0. In other words the output switches on if neither the first NOR the second input is 1. The symbol for the NOR gate is: The truth table for the NOR gate is shown below. The examples given were easy. Each job only needed one logic gate. However any decision making circuit can be built with logic gates no matter how complicated the decision. Here is an example. Each logic gate is manufactured from two or more transistors. Other circuits can be made using logic gates as we shall see in the next section. We shall show you how to count and store numbers using logic gates. This means that if you have enough transistors and you connect them correctly to make the right logic gates you can make circuits which count and store numbers. In practice the cheapest gate to manufacture is usually the NAND gate. Additionally Charles Peirce showed that NAND gates alone (as well as NOR gates alone) can be used to reproduce all the other logic gates. ,There are five main types of logic gate: NOT AND OR NAND and NOR. Each one makes its decision in different way. The NOT Gate Problem: You want an automatic circuit in your office to turn on the heating in the winter. You already have digital Electron Temperature sensor. When the Temperature is high it sends out 1. When the office is cold it sends out 0. If this signal were sent straight to the heater the heater would turn on (1) when it was already hot and would stay off when it was cold. This is wrong To make the heater Work (physics) we need circuit which will change (from the sensor) into (to send to the heater). This will make the heater come on when it is cold. You also want it to change (from the sensor) into (to send to the heater). This will turn the heater off when the room is hot. This circuit is called an inverter or NOT gate. It changes into (1 is NOT 0). It changes into (0 is NOT 1). It changes signal into what it is NOT. The symbol for the NOT gate is: The action of the NOT gate is written in table called truth table. The left column shows the possible inputs on different rows. The right column shows what the output (decision) of the circuit will be for that input. The truth table for the NOT gate is shown below. When you read the truth table the top row says If the input is the output will be 1. For our heater this means If the room is cold the heater will turn on. The bottom row says If the input is the output will be 0. For our heater this means If the room is hot the heater will switch off. The AND Gate Problem: An airliner has two toilets. Passengers get annoyed if they get up from their seat only to find that both toilets are being used and they have to go back to their seat and wait. You want to fit an automatic circuit to Light up display if both toilets are in use. Then passengers know that if the Light is off there will be free toilet for them to use. There is sensor in each toilet. It gives out of the toilet is free and if it is in use. You want to send to the display unit if both sensors are sending 1s. To do this you use an AND gate.

392,392,29.6.1,Binary numbers,616,In normal (denary) numbers we write 9+1 as 10. The fact that the in 10 is the second digit from the right tells us that it actually means 10 and not 1. Similarly the in 365 represents 300 because it is the third digit from the right. You could write 365 as 100 10 5. You will notice the pattern that the nth digit from the right represents 10n1. In binary we use the nth digit from the right to represent 2n1. Thus is written as 10 in binary. Similarly 22 is written as 100 in binary and 23 is written as 1000 in binary. How do you write numbers as sum of powers of two? The first power of two (the largest) is the largest power of two which is not larger than the number you are working with. In our last example where we wanted to know what twelve was in binary the largest power of two which is not larger than 12 is 8. Thus 12 something. By arithmetic the something must be and the largest power of two not larger than this is exactly. Thus 12 and we have finished. more complicated example would be to write one hundred in binary. The largest power of two not larger than 100 is 64 (1000000 in binary). Subtracting 64 from 100 leaves 36. The largest power of two not larger than 36 is 32 (100000 in binary). Removing this leaves remainder of which is power of two itself (100 in binary). Thus one hundred is 64 32 or in binary 1000000 100000 100 1100100. Once number is written in binary it can be represented using the low and high voltage levels of digital electronics.

393,393,29.6.2,Counting circuits,617,To make counter you need several flip flops sometimes called divide by two circuits. flip flop is digital circuit which swaps its output (from to or from to 0) whenever the input changes from to 0. When the input changes from to it doesnt change its output. It is called flip flop because it changes (flips or flops) each time it receives pulse. If you put series of pulses 10101010 into flip flop the result is 01100110. Figure 29.18 makes this clearer. As you can see from Figure 29.18 there are half as many pulses in the output. This is why it is called divide by two circuit. If we connect flip flops in chain then we make counter which can count pulses. As an example we connect three flip flops in chain. This is shown in Figure 29.19. When this circuit is fed with stream of pulses the outputs of the different stages change. The table below shows how this happens. Each row shows different stage with the first stage at the top. We assume that all of the flip flops have as their output to start with. Figure 29.18: The output of flip flop or divide by two circuit when square wave is connected to the input. The output changes state when the input goes from to 0. Figure 29.19: Three flip flops connected together in chain to make counter. The input of each flip flop is labelled while each output is labelled Q. The pulses are connected to the input on the left. The outputs Q0 Q1 and Q2 give the three digits of the binary number as the pulses are counted. This is explained in the text and in the next table. The binary numbers in the right hand column count the pulses arriving at the input. You will notice that the output of the first flip flop gives the right most digit of the pulse count (in binary). The output of the second flip flop gives the second digit from the right (the twos digit) of the pulse count. The output of the third flip flop gives the third digit from the right (the fours digit) of the pulse count. As there are only three flip flops there is nothing to provide the next digit (the eights digit) and so the eighth pulse is recorded as 000 not 1000. This device is called modulo counter because it can count in eight stages from 000 to 111 before it goes back to 000. If you put four flip flops in the counter it will count in sixteen stages from 0000 to 1111 and it is called modulo 16 counter because it counts in sixteen stages before going back to 0000. Definition: Modulo The modulo of counter tells you how many stages (or pulses) it receives before going back to as its output. Thus modulo counter counts in eight stages 000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111 then returns to 000 again. ,To make counter you need several flip flops sometimes called divide by two circuits. flip flop is digital circuit which swaps its output (from to or from to 0) whenever the input changes from to 0.

As there are only three flip flops there is nothing to provide the next digit (the eights digit) and so the eighth pulse is recorded as 000 not 1000. This device is called modulo counter because it can count in eight stages from 000 to 111 before it goes back to 000. If you put four flip flops in the counter it will count in sixteen stages from 0000 to 1111 and it is called modulo 16 counter because it counts in sixteen stages before going back to 0000. Definition: Modulo The modulo of counter tells you how many stages (or pulses) it receives before going back to as its output. Thus modulo counter counts in eight stages 000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111 then returns to 000 again.
394,394,29.6.3,Storing binary numbers,619,Counting is important. However it is equally important to be able to remember the numbers. Computers can convert almost anything to string of 0s and 1s and therefore to binary number. Unless this number can be stored in the computers memory the computer would be useless. The memory in the computer contains many parts. Each part is able to store single or 1. Since and are the two binary digits we say that each part of the memory stores one bit. Figure 29.20: bistable circuit made from two NOR gates. This circuit is able to store one bit of digital information. With the two inputs set to you can see that the output could be (and will remain) either or 1. The circuit on the left shows an output of the circuit on the right shows an output of 1. Wires carrying high logic levels (1) are drawn thicker. The output of the bistable is labelled Q. Definition: Bit One bit is short way of saying one binary digit. It is single or 1. If you have eight bits you can store binary number from 00000000 to 11111111 (0 to 255 in denary). This gives you enough permutations of 0s and 1s to have one for each letter of the alphabet (in upper and lower case) each digit from to each punctuation mark and each control code used by computer in storing document. When you type text into word processor each character is stored as set of eight bits. Each set of eight bits is called byte. Computer memories are graded according to how many bytes they store. There are 1024 bytes in kilobyte (kB) 1024 1024 bytes in megabyte (MB) and 1024 1024 1024 bytes in gigabyte (GB). To store bit we need circuit which can remember or 1. This is called bistable circuit because it has two stable states. It can stay indefinitely either as or 1. An example of bistable circuit is shown in Figure 29.20. It is made from two NOR gates. To store the or the in the bistable circuit you set one of the inputs to then put it back to again. If the input labelled (set) is raised the output will immediately become 1. This is shown in Figure 29.21. To store you raise the (reset) input to 1. This is shown in Figure 29.22. Once you have used the or inputs to set or reset the bistable circuit you then bring both inputs back to 0. The bistable remembers the state. Because of the ease with which the circuit can be Reset and Set it is also called RS flip flop circuit. computer memory will be able to store millions or billions of bits. If it used our circuit above it would need millions or billions of NOR gates each of which is made from several transistors. The computer memory is made of many millions of transistors. The bistable circuits drawn here dont remember 0s or 1s for ever they lose the information if the power is turned off. The same is true for the RAM (Random Access Memory) used to store working and temporary data in computer. Some modern circuits contain special memory which can remember its state even if the power is turned off. This is used in FLASH drives commonly found in USB data sticks and on the memory cards used with digital cameras. These bistable circuits are much more complex.

396,396,30.1,Introduction,625,This chapter will focus on the electromagnetic (EM) radiation. Electromagnetic radiation is self-propagating wave in space with electric and magnetic components. These components oscillate at right angles to each other and to the direction of propagation and are in phase with each other.

397,397,30.2,Particle/wave nature of electromagnetic radiation,625,If you watch colony of ants walking up the wall they look like thin continuous black line. But as you look closer you see that the line is made up of thousands of separated black ants. Light and all other types of electromagnetic radiation seems like continuous wave at first but when one performs experiments on the light one can notice that the light can have both wave and particle like properties. Just like the individual ants the light can also be made up of individual bundles of energy or quanta of light. Light has both wave-like and particle-like properties (waveparticle duality) but only shows one or the other depending on the kind of experiment we perform. wave-type experiment shows the wave nature and particle-type experiment shows particle nature. One cannot test the wave and the particle nature at the same time. particle of light is called photon. Definition: Photon photon is quantum (energy packet) of light. The particle nature of light can be demonstrated by the interaction of photons with matter. One way in which light interacts with matter is via the photoelectric effect which will be studied in detail in Chapter 31. ,If you watch colony of ants walking up the wall they look like thin continuous black line.

398,398,30.3,The wave nature of electromagnetic radiation,626,Accelerating charges emit electromagnetic waves. We have seen that changing electric field generates magnetic field and changing magnetic field generates an electric field. This is the principle behind the propagation of electromagnetic waves because electromagnetic waves unlike sound waves do not need medium to travel through. EM waves propagate when an electric field oscillating in one plane produces magnetic field oscillating in plane at right angles to it which produces an oscillating electric field and so on. The propagation of electromagnetic waves can be described as mutual induction. These mutually regenerating fields travel through space at constant speed of 108m s1 represented by c. ,Accelerating Electric charge emit electromagnetic Wave We have seen that changing Electric field generates Magnet Field (physics) and changing Magnet Field (physics) generates an Electric field This is the principle behind the propagation of electromagnetic Wave because electromagnetic Wave unlike Sound Wave do not need medium to travel through.

399,399,30.4,Electromagnetic spectrum,626,Observe the things around you your friend sitting next to you large tree across the field. How is it that you are able to see these things? What is it that is leaving your friends arm and entering your eye so that you can see his arm? It is light. The light originally comes from the sun or possibly light bulb or burning fire. In physics light is given the more technical term electromagnetic radiation which includes all forms of light not just the form which you can see with your eyes. Electromagnetic radiation allows us to observe the world around us. It is this radiation which reflects off of the objects around you and into your eye. The radiation your eye is sensitive to is only small fraction of the total radiation emitted in the physical universe. All of the different fractions taped together make up the electromagnetic spectrum. When white light is split into its component colours by prism you are looking at portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The wavelength of particular electromagnetic radiation will depend on how it was created. The radiation can take on any wavelength which means that the spectrum is continuous. Physicists broke down this continuous band into sections. Each section is defined by how the radiation is created not the radiations wavelength. But each category is continuous within the min and max wavelength of that category meaning there are no wavelengths excluded within some range. The spectrum is in order of wavelength with the shortest wavelength at one end and the longest wavelength at the other. The spectrum is then broken down into categories as detailed in Table 30.1. Since an electromagnetic wave is still wave the following equation that you learnt in Grade 10 still applies: In theory the spectrum is infinite although realistically we can only observe wavelengths from few hundred kilometers to those of gamma rays due to experimental limitations. Humans experience electromagnetic waves differently depending on their wavelength. Our eyes are sensitive to visible light while our skin is sensitive to infrared and many wavelengths we do not detect at all. ,Observe the things around you your friend sitting next to you large tree across the Field (physics) How is it that you are able to see these things?

401,401,30.6,Penetrating ability of electromagnetic radiation,631,Different kinds of electromagnetic radiation have different penetrabilities. For example if we take the human body as the object. Infrared light is emitted by the human body. Visible light is reflected off the surface of the human body ultra-violet light (from sunlight) damages the skin but X-rays are able to penetrate the skin and bone and allows for pictures of the inside of the human body to be taken. If we compare the energy of visible light to the energy of X-rays we find that X-rays have much higher energy. Usually kinds of electromagnetic radiation with higher energy have higher penetrabilities than those with low energies. Certain kinds of electromagnetic radiation such as ultra-violet radiation X-rays and gamma rays are very dangerous. Radiation such as these are called ionising radiation. Ionising radiation loses energy as it passes through matter breaking molecular bonds and creating ions. Excessive exposure to radiation including sunlight X-rays and all nuclear radiations can cause destruction of biological tissue. ,Different kinds of Electromagnetic radiation have different penetrabilities.

402,402,30.6.1,Ultraviolet(UV) radiation and the skin,631,UVA and UVB are different ranges of frequencies for ultraviolet (UV) light. UVA and UVB can damage collagen fibres which results in the speeding up skin aging. In general UVA is the least harmful but it can contribute to the aging of skin DNA damage and possibly skin cancer. It penetrates deeply and does not cause sunburn. Because it does not cause reddening of the skin (erythema) it cannot be measured in the SPF testing. There is no good clinical measurement of the blocking of UVA radiation but it is important that sunscreen block both UVA and UVB. UVB light can cause skin cancer. The radiation excites DNA molecules in skin cells resulting in possible mutations which can cause cancer. This cancer connection is one reason for concern about ozone depletion and the ozone hole. As defense against UV radiation the body tans when exposed to moderate (depending on skin type) levels of radiation by releasing the brown pigment melanin. This helps to block UV penetration and prevent damage to the vulnerable skin tissues deeper down. Suntan lotion often referred to as sunblock or sunscreen partly blocks UV and is widely available. Most of these products contain an SPF rating that describes the amount of protection given. This protection however applies only to UVB rays responsible for sunburn and not to UVA rays that penetrate more deeply into the skin and may also be responsible for causing cancer and wrinkles. Some sunscreen lotion now includes compounds such as titanium dioxide which helps protect against UVA rays. Other UVA blocking compounds found in sunscreen include zinc oxide and avobenzone. ,UVA and UVB are different ranges of Frequency for ultraviolet (UV) Light UVA and UVB can damage collagen fibres which results in the Speed up skin aging.

403,403,30.6.2,Ultraviolet radiation and the eyes,632,High intensities of UVB light are hazardous to the eyes and exposure can cause welders flash (photo keratitis or arc eye) and may lead to cataracts pterygium and pinguecula formation. Protective eyewear is beneficial to those who are working with or those who might be exposed to ultraviolet radiation particularly short wave UV. Given that light may reach the eye from the sides full coverage eye protection is usually warranted if there is an increased risk of exposure as in high altitude mountaineering. Mountaineers are exposed to higher than ordinary levels of UV radiation both because there is less atmospheric filtering and because of reflection from snow and ice. Ordinary untreated eyeglasses give some protection. Most plastic lenses give more protection than glass lenses. Some plastic lens materials such as polycarbonate block most UV. There are protective treatments available for eyeglass lenses that need it which will give better protection. But even treatment that completely blocks UV will not protect the eye from light that arrives around the lens. To convince yourself of the potential dangers of stray UV light cover your lenses with something opaque like aluminum foil stand next to bright light and consider how much light you see despite the complete blockage of the lenses. Most contact lenses help to protect the retina by absorbing UV radiation. ,High intensities of UVB Light are hazardous to the eyes and exposure can cause welders flash (photo keratitis or arc eye) and may lead to cataracts pterygium and pinguecula formation.

Given that Light may reach the eye from the sides full coverage eye protection is usually warranted if there is an increased risk of exposure as in high altitude mountaineering. Mountaineers are exposed to higher than ordinary levels of UV radiation both because there is less atmospheric filtering and because of Reflection (physics) from snow and ice. Ordinary untreated eyeglasses give some protection. Most Plasticity (physics) lenses give more protection than glass lenses. Some Plasticity (physics) lens materials such as polycarbonate block most UV. There are protective treatments available for eyeglass lenses that need it which will give better protection. But even treatment that completely blocks UV will not protect the eye from Light that arrives around the lens. To convince yourself of the potential dangers of stray UV Light cover your lenses with something opaque like aluminum foil stand next to bright Light and consider how much Light you see despite the complete blockage of the lenses.

409,409,31.2.1,Energy levels of an electron,635,We have seen that the electrons in an atom have different energy levels. When the electron receives enough energy it can jump up to higher energy level. This is called exciting the electron. When the electron in high energy level sheds some energy it drops to lower energy level. We have also seen that the energy associated with light at specific wavelength is given by: hc In the particle model of light this means that each packet of light (photon) at wavelength has energy: hc For the electron to receive energy it absorbs photon and gets its energy. When an electron loses energy to drop to lower level it emits (gives off) photon with that energy. ,We have seen that the Electron in an atom have different Energy level When the Electron receives enough Energy it can jump up to higher Energy level This is called exciting the Electron When the Electron in high Energy level sheds some Energy it drops to lower Energy level We have also seen that the Energy associated with Light at specific Wavelength is given by: hc In the particle model of Light this means that each packet of Light (photon) at Wavelength has Energy hc For the Electron to receive Energy it absorbs photon and gets its Energy When an Electron loses Energy to drop to lower level it emits (gives off) photon with that Energy ,We have seen that the <b>Electron</b> in an atom have different <b>Energy level</b> When the <b>Electron</b> receives enough <b>Energy</b> it can jump up to higher <b>Energy level</b> This is called exciting the <b>Electron</b> When the <b>Electron</b> in high <b>Energy level</b> sheds some <b>Energy</b> it drops to lower <b>Energy level</b> We have also seen that the <b>Energy</b> associated with <b>Light</b> at specific <b>Wavelength</b> is given by: hc In the particle model of <b>Light</b> this means that each packet of <b>Light</b> (photon) at <b>Wavelength</b> has <b>Energy</b> hc For the <b>Electron</b> to receive <b>Energy</b> it absorbs photon and gets its <b>Energy</b> When an <b>Electron</b> loses <b>Energy</b> to drop to lower level it emits (gives off) photon with that <b>Energy</b>
410,410,31.2.2,Interaction of light with metals,636,When light encounters or passes through material the photons of the light interact with the atoms or molecules of the material. Depending on the strength of the interactions and how often they happen the light will pass through the material or be scattered in some other direction. Each wavelength of light relates to particular energy and the closer that energy is to the energy difference between two of the levels of the atom the likelier the photon is to interact with the atom. When visible or ultraviolet (UV) radiation shines on metal the photons are absorbed by the electrons in the metal. The electrons are then excited up to higher energy level. When an electron returns to lower energy level another photon is emitted. This is how light is reflected off metal surface. In previous chapters you have studied geometrical optics which tells us what happens to rays of light when they are reflected off surface or refracted through lens. That tells us what happens to light rays made up of many photons on large scale. If you look at smaller level i.e. on microscopic scale then reflection and refraction happen by all the photons interacting with the atoms of the lens or mirror. The photons get absorbed and re-emitted many times before emerging as the finals rays of light that we see. Scattering of light is responsible for many effects in everyday life. We see that certain materials are red or blue for example since they contain materials that have energy level differences that correspond to the energies of the photons that make up red or blue light. These materials then reflect the red or blue light and absorb the other wavelengths in the visible spectrum. White objects reflect photons of all wavelengths in the visual spectrum while black objects absorb these photons. Because truly black object absorbs all the visual wavelengths of light and does not re-emit photons at visual wavelengths we can say that black is not colour itself but rather lack of colour Also since black objects absorb visual light they heat up more than objects of other colours which reflect light at certain wavelengths. Metals generally reflect most wavelengths of visible light but they will reflect the light in certain direction given by the laws of reflection in geometrical optics. This is different to most materials like wood or fabric which reflect light in all directions. Metals have this property since they have electrons that are not bound to atoms and can move freely through the metal. This is unlike most other materials that have their electrons bound closely to the atoms. These free electrons in metals can then absorb and reflect photons of wide range of energies. Ultraviolet light (which has shorter wavelengths than visible light) will pass through some substances such as many plastics because they do not have the right energy levels to absorb it and re-emit it. X-rays (also short wavelengths) will also pass through most materials since the energies of X-rays correspond to the energy levels of atomic nuclei. Such nuclei are much smaller than atoms so it is much less likely for an X-ray to hit nucleus instead of the whole atom. Most materials will absorb infrared radiation (longer wavelengths than visible light) since the energies of that radiation often correspond to rotational or vibrational energy levels of molecules. ,When Light encounters or passes through material the photons of the Light interact with the atoms or molecules of the material.

411,411,31.2.3,Why is the sky blue?,637,The sun emits light in many different wavelengths including all of the visible wavelengths. Light which is made up of all the visible wavelengths appears white. So what causes the sky to look blue? The air is not just full of nitrogen and oxygen gases. It is also full of tiny dust grains. The light from the sun scatters off these many dust grains. The chance that the light will scatter off one of these dust grains is bigger for shorter wavelengths. The short wavelength blue light is therefore scattered much more than the other colors. At noon when the light from the sun is coming straight down (see the picture below) the scattered blue light reaches your eyes from all directions and so the sky appears blue. The other wavelengths do not get scattered much and therefore miss your line of sight. At sunrise or sunset the direction of the light coming from the sun is now straight towards your eyes (see picture below). Therefore the scattered blue light cant be seen because it is scattered out of your line of sight. The redder colours (oranges and reds) can now be seen because they are not scattered as much and still fall in your line of sight. ,The sun emits Light in many different Wavelength including all of the visible Wavelength Light which is made up of all the visible Wavelength appears white.

412,412,31.3,The photoelectric effect,638,Around the turn of the twentieth century it was observed by number of physicists (including Hertz Thomson and Von Lenard) that when light was shone on metal electrons were emitted by the metal. This is called the photoelectric effect. (photo- for light electric- for the electron.) Definition: The photoelectric effect The photoelectric effect is the process whereby an electron is emitted by metal when light shines on it. At that time light was thought to be purely wave. Therefore physicists thought that if more intense (i.e. brighter) light was shone on metal then the electrons would be knocked out with greater kinetic energies than if faint light was shone on them. However Von Lenard observed that this did not happen at all. The intensity of the light made no difference to the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons Also it was observed that the electrons were emitted immediately when light was shone on the metal there was no time delay. Einstein solved this problem by proposing that light is made up of packets of energy called quanta (now called photons) which interacted with the electrons in the metal like particles instead of waves. Each incident photon would transfer all its energy to one electron in the metal. For specific colour of light (i.e. certain wavelength or frequency) the energy of the photons is given by hf hc where is Plancks constant. The energy needed to knock an electron out of the metal is called the work function (symbol of the metal. Therefore the amount of energy left over as the kinetic energy (Ek) of the emitted electron would be the difference between the incoming photons energy and the energy needed to knock out the electron (work function of the metal): Ek hf Increasing the intensity of the light (i.e. making it brighter) did not change the wavelength of the light and therefore the electrons would be emitted with the same kinetic energy as before This solved the paradox and showed that light has both wave nature and particle nature. Einstein won the Nobel prize for this quantum theory and his explanation of the photoelectric effect. Increasing the intensity of the light actually means increasing the number of incident photons. Therefore since each photon only gives energy to one electron more incident photons meansmore electrons would be knocked out of the metal but their kinetic energies would be the same as before. The photoelectric effect was first observed in the experiments of Heinrich Hertz in 1887. In 1899 J.J. Thomson proved that it was electrons that were emitted. The photoelectric effect was theoretically explained by Albert Einstein in 1905. The discovery and understanding of the photoelectric effect was one of the major breakthroughs in science in the twentieth century as it provided concrete evidence of the particle nature of light. It overturned previously held views that light was composed purely of continuous transverse wave. On the one hand the wave nature is good description of phenomena such as diffraction and interference for light and on the other hand the photoelectric effect demonstrates the particle nature of light. This is now known as the dual-nature of light. (dual means two) While solving problems we need to decide for ourselves whether we should consider the wave property or the particle property of light. For example when dealing with interference and diffraction light should be treated as wave whereas when dealing with photoelectric effect we consider the particle nature. ,Around the turn of the twentieth century it was observed by number of physicists (including Hertz Thomson and Von Lenard) that when Light was shone on metal Electron were emitted by the metal.

413,413,31.3.1,Applications of the photoelectric effect,640,We have learnt that metal contains electrons that are free to move between the valence and conduction bands. When photon strikes the surface of metal it gives all its energy to one electron in the metal. If the photon energy is equal to the energy between two energy levels then the electron is excited to the higher energy level. If the photon energy is greater than or equal to the work function (energy needed to escape from the metal) then the electron is emitted from the surface of the metal (the photoelectric effect). The work function is different for different elements. The smaller the work function the easier it is for electrons to be emitted from the metal. Metals with low work functions make good conductors. This is because the electrons are attached less strongly to their surroundings and can move more easily through these materials. This reduces the resistance of the material to the flow of current i.e. it conducts well. Table 31.1 shows the work functions for range of elements. The electron volt is the kinetic energy gained by an electron passing through potential difference of one volt (1 V). volt is not measure of energy but the electron volt is unit of energy. When you connect 1.5 Volt battery to circuit you can give 1.5 eV of energy to every electron. ,We have learnt that metal contains Electron that are free to move between the valence and conduction bands.

414,414,31.3.2,Real-life applications,642,Solar Cells The photo-electric effect may seem like very easy way to produce electricity from the sun. This is why people choose to make solar panels out of materials like silicon to generate electricity. In real-life however the amount of electricity generated is less than expected. This is because not every photon knocks out an electron. Other processes such as reflection or scattering also happen. This means that only fraction 10 (depends on the material) of the photons produce photoelectrons. This drop in efficiency results in lower measured current. Much work is being done in industry to improve this efficiency so that the panels can generate as high current as possible and create as much electricity as possible form the sun.

415,415,31.4,Emission and absorption spectra,643,,,
416,416,31.4.1,Emission Spectra,643,You have learnt previously about the structure of an atom. The electrons surrounding the atomic nucleus are arranged in series of levels of increasing energy. Each element has its own distinct set of energy levels. This arrangement of energy levels serves as the atoms unique fingerprint. In the early 1900s scientists found that liquid or solid heated to high temperatures would give off broad range of colours of light. However gas heated to similar temperatures would emit light only at certain specific colours (wavelengths). The reason for this observation was not understood at the time. Scientists studied this effect using discharge tube. Figure 31.3: Diagram of discharge tube. The tube is filled with gas. When high enough voltage is applied to both ends of the tube the gas ionises and acts like conductor allowing current to flow through the circuit. The current excites the atoms of the ionised gas. When the atoms fall back to their ground state they emit photons to carry off the excess energy. discharge tube (Figure 31.3) is glass gas-filled tube with metal plate at both ends. If large enough voltage difference is applied between the two metal plates the gas atoms inside the tube will absorb enough energy to make some of their electrons come off i.e. the gas atoms are ionised. These electrons start moving through the gas and create current which raises some electrons in other atoms to higher energy levels. Then as the electrons in the atoms fall back down they emit electromagnetic radiation. The amount of light emitted at different wavelengths called the emission spectrum is shown for discharge tube filled with hydrogen gas in figure 31.4 below. Only certain wavelengths (i.e. colours) of light are seen as shown by the thick black lines in the picture. Figure 31.4: Diagram of the emission spectrum of hydrogen in the visible spectrum. Four lines are visible and are labeled with their wavelengths. The three lines in the 400500 nm range are in the blue part of the spectrum while the higher line (656 nm) is in the redorange part. Eventually scientists realized that these lines come from photons of specific energy emitted by electrons making transitions between specific energy levels of the atom. Figure ?? shows an example of this happening. When an electron in an atom falls from higher energy level to lower energy level it emits photon to carry off the extra energy. This photons energy is equal to the energy difference between the two energy levels. As we previously discussed the frequency of photon is related to its energy through the equation hf. Since specific photon frequency (or wavelength) gives us specific colour we can see how each coloured line is associated with specific transition. Figure 31.5: In this diagram are shown some of the electron energy levels for the hydrogen atom. The arrows show the electron transitions from higher energy levels to lower energy levels. The energies of the emitted photons are the same as the energy difference between two energy levels. You can think of absorption as the opposite process. The arrows would point upwards and the electrons would jump up to higher levels when they absorp photon of the right energy. Visible light is not the only kind of electromagnetic radiation emitted. More energetic or less energetic transitions can produce ultraviolet or infrared radiation. However because each atom has its own distinct set of energy levels (its fingerprint) each atom has its own distinct emission spectrum. ,You have learnt previously about the structure of an atom.

417,417,31.4.2,Absorption spectra,644,As you know atoms do not only emit photons they also absorb photons. If photon hits an atom and the energy of the photon is the same as the gap between two electron energy levels in the atom then the electron can absorb the photon and jump up to the higher energy level. If the atom has no energy level differences that equal the incoming photons energy it cannot absorb the photon and can only scatter it. Using this effect if we have source of photons of various energies we can obtain the absorption spectra for different materials. To get an absorption spectrum just shine white light on sample of the material that you are interested in. White light is made up of all the different wavelengths of visible light put together. In the absorption spectrum the energy levels corresponding to the absorbed photons show up as black lines because the photons of these wavelengths have been absorbed and dont show up. Because of this the absorption spectrum is the exact inverse of the emission spectrum. Look at the two figures below. In figure 31.6 you can see the emission lines of hyrodrogen. Figure 31.7 shows the absorption spectrum. It is the exact opposite of the emission spectrum Both emission and absorption techniques can be used to get the same information about the energy levels of an atom. ,As you know atoms do not only emit photons they also absorb photons.

419,419,31.4.4,Applications of emission and absorption spectra,648,The study of spectra from stars and galaxies in astronomy is called spectroscopy. Spectroscopy is tool widely used in astronomy to learn different things about astronomical objects. Identifying elements in astronomical objects using their spectra Measuring the spectrum of light from star can tell astronomers what the star is made of Since each element emits or absorbs light only at particular wavelengths astronomers can identify what elements are in the stars from the lines in their spectra. From studying the spectra of many stars we know that there are many different types of stars which contain different elements and in different amounts. Determining velocities of galaxies using spectroscopy You have already learned in Chapter 24 about the Doppler effect and how the frequency (and wavelength) of sound waves changes depending on whether the object emitting the sound is moving towards or away from you. The same thing happens to electromagnetic radiation. If the object emitting the light is moving towards us then the wavelength of the light appears shorter (called blue-shifted). If the object is moving away from us then the wavelength of its light appears stretched out (called red-shifted). The Doppler effect affects the spectra of objects in space depending on their motion relative to us on the earth. For example the light from distant galaxy which is moving away from us at some velocity will appear red-shifted. This means that the emission and absorption lines in the galaxys spectrum will be shifted to longer wavelength (lower frequency). Knowing where each line in the spectrum would normally be if the galaxy was not moving and comparing to their red-shifted positions allows astronomers to precisely measure the velocity of the galaxy relative to the earth Global warming and greenhouse gases The sun emits radiation (light) over range of wavelengths which are mainly in the visible part of the spectrum. Radiation at these wavelengths passes through the gases of the atmosphere to warm the land and the oceans below. The warm earth then radiates this heat at longer infrared wavelengths. Carbon-dioxide (one of the main greenhouse gases) in the atmosphere has energy levels which correspond to the infrared wavelengths which allow it to absorb the infrared radiation. It then also emits at infrared wavelengths in all directions. This effect stops large amount of the infrared radiation getting out of the atmosphere which causes the atmosphere and the earth to heat up. More radiation is coming in than is getting back out. Therefore increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere increases the amount of trapped infrared radiation and therefore the overall temperature of the earth. The earth is very sensitive and complicated system upon which life depends and changing the delicate balances of temperature and atmospheric gas content may have disastrous consequences if we are not careful. ,The study of spectra from stars and galaxies in astronomy is called spectroscopy.

420,420,31.5,Lasers,650,laser is device that produces special type of light: all the laser photons are identical They all have the same wavelength (and frequency) amplitude and phase. Since they all have the same wavelength this means they all have the same colour and the light is called monochromatic. (Note: mono means one or single and chromatic means colour.) This is very different to most other light sources which produce light with range of wavelengths (e.g. white light from the sun consists of all the visible wavelengths.) Laser light is highly directional and can be focused very well. This focus allows laser beams to be used over long distances and to pack lot of energy into the beam while still requiring reasonably small amounts of energy to be generated. Each centimetre of typical laser beam contains many billions of photons. These special properties of laser light come from the way in which the laser photons are created and the energy levels of the material that makes up the laser. These properties make laser light extremely useful in many applications from CD players to eye surgery. The term LASER stands for Light Amplification by the Stimulated Emission of Radiation. This stimulated emission is different to the spontaneous emission already discussed earlier. Lets review the absorption and emission processes which can occur in atoms. Absorption: As you can see in the picture above absorption happens when an electron jumps up to higher energy level by absorbing photon which has an energy equal to the energy difference between the two energy levels. Spontaneous emission: Spontaneous emission is when an electron in higher energy level drops down to lower energy level and photon is emitted with an energy equal to the energy difference between the two levels. There is no interference in this process from outside factors. Usually spontaneous emission happens very quickly after an electron gets into an excited state. In other words the lifetime of the excited state is very short. However there are some excited states where an electron can remain in the higher energy level for longer time than usual before dropping down to lower level. These excited states are called metastable states. Stimulated emission: As the picture above shows stimulated emission happens when photon with an energy equal to the energy difference between two levels interacts with an electron in the higher level. This stimulates the electron to emit an identical photon and drop down to the lower energy level. This process results in two photons at the end. Definition: Spontaneous Emission Spontaneous emission occurs when an atom is in an unstable excited state and randomly decays to less energetic state emitting photon to carry off the excess energy. The unstable state decays in characteristic time called the lifetime. Definition: Meta-stable state meta-stable state is an excited atomic state that has an unusually long lifetime compared to the lifetimes of other excited states of that atom. While most excited states have lifetimes measured in microseconds and nanoseconds (106 and 109 s) meta-stable states can have lifetimes of milliseconds (103 s) or even seconds. Definition: Stimulated emission Stimulated emission occurs when photon interacts with an excited atom causing the atom to decay and emit another identical photon. ,Laser is device that produces special type of Light all the Laser photons are identical They all have the same Wavelength (and Frequency Amplitude and phase.

However there are some excited states where an Electron can remain in the higher Energy level for longer time than usual before dropping down to lower level. These excited states are called metastable states. Stimulated Emission spectrum As the picture above shows stimulated Emission spectrum happens when photon with an Energy equal to the Energy difference between two levels interacts with an Electron in the higher level. This stimulates the Electron to emit an identical photon and drop down to the lower Energy level This process results in two photons at the end. Definition: Spontaneous Emission spectrum Spontaneous Emission spectrum occurs when an atom is in an unstable excited state and randomly decays to less energetic state emitting photon to carry off the excess Energy The unstable state decays in characteristic time called the lifetime. Definition: Meta-stable state meta-stable state is an excited atomic state that has an unusually long lifetime compared to the lifetimes of other excited states of that atom. While most excited states have lifetimes measured in microseconds and nanoseconds (106 and 109 s) meta-stable states can have lifetimes of milliseconds (103 s) or even seconds.

421,421,31.5.1,How a laser works,652,The important process involved in how laser works is stimulated emission as you can tell from what laser stands for You can imagine that stimulated emission can lead to more and more identical photons being released in the following way: Imagine we have an electron in an excited metastable state and it drops down to the ground state by emitting photon. If this photon then travels through the material and meets another electron in the metastable excited state this will cause the electron to drop down to the lower energy level and another photon to be emitted. Now there are two photons of the same energy. If these photons then both move through the material and each interacts with another electron in metastable state this will result in them each causing an additional photon to be released. i.e. from photons we then get and so on This is how laser light is produced. Figure 31.8: Spontaneous emission is two step process as shown here. First energy from an external source is applied to an atom in the laser medium raising its energy to an excited (metastable) state. After some time it will decay back down to its ground state and emit the excess energy in the form of photon. This is the first stage in the formation of laser beam. Figure 31.9: Stimulated emission is also two step process as shown here. First laser photon encounters an atom that has been raised to an excited state just like in the case of spontaneous emission. The photon then causes the atom to decay to its ground state and emit another photon identical to the incoming photon. This is the second step in the creation of laser beam. It happens many many times as the laser photons pass through the optical cavity until the laser beam builds up to full strength. This can only happen if there are many electrons in metastable state. If most of the electrons are in the ground state then they will just absorb the photons and no extra photons will be emitted. However if more electrons are in the excited metastable state than in the ground state then the process of stimulated emission will be able to continue. Usually in atoms most of the electrons are in the lower energy levels and only few are in excited states. When most of the electrons are in the excited metastable state and only few are in the ground state this is called population inversion (the populations are swapped around) and this is when stimulated emission can occur. To start off the process the electrons first have to be excited up into the metastable state. This is done using an external energy source. Definition: Population inversion Population inversion is when more atoms are in an excited state than in their ground state. It is necessary condition to sustain laser beam so that there are enough excited atoms that can be stimulated to emit more photons. Therefore materials used to make laser light must must have metastable states which can allow population inversion to occur when an external energy source is applied. Some substances which are used to make lasers are listed in table 31.3. You can see that gases (such as Helium-Neon mixture) liquids (such as dyes) and solids (such as the precious stone ruby) are all used to make lasers.

422,422,31.5.2,A simple laser,654,laser consists of number of different parts that work together to create the laser beam. Figure 31.10 shows the different parts of the laser while Figure 31.11 shows how they create the laser beam. The basis of the laser is the laser material. The laser material consists of the atoms that are used to create the laser beam. Many different materials can be used as laser material and their energy levels determine the characteristics of the laser. Some examples of different lasers are shown in Table 31.3. The laser material is contained in the optical cavity. Before the laser is turned on all the atoms in the laser material are in their ground state. The first step in creating laser beam is to add energy to the laser material to raise most of the electrons into an excited metastable state. This is called pumping the laser. The creation of the laser beam starts through the process of spontaneous emission shown in Figure 31.8. An electron drops down to the ground state and emits photon with energy equal to the energy difference of the two energy levels. This laser photon is the beginning of the laser Figure 31.11: Diagram of laser showing the process of creating laser beam. (1) source of external energy is applied to the laser medium raising the atoms to an excited state. (2) An excited atom decays though spontaneous emission emitting photon. (3) The photon encounters another excited atom and causes it to decay through stimulated emission creating another photon. (4) The photons bounce back and forth through the laser medium between the mirrors building up more and more photons. (5) small percentage of the photons pass through the partially-silvered mirror to become the laser beam we see. beam. Sometimes laser photon runs into another excited electron. Then stimulated emission occurs and the electron drops down to the ground state and emits an additional identical photon as shown in Figure 31.9. Since the laser material typically has large number of atoms one laser photon passing through this material will rapidly cause large number of photons just like it to be emitted. The optical cavity keeps the laser photons inside the laser cavity so they can build up the laser beam. At each end is concave mirror one is full mirror and one is partial mirror. The full mirror is totally reflective. The partial mirror transmits small amount of the light that hits it(less than 1). The mirrors are carefully aligned so that photons that reflect off one mirror become trapped and bounce back and forth between the mirrors many times causing more and more stimulated emission. The photons that eventually escape through the partially-silvered mirror become the laser beam that we see. As the photons bounce between mirrors they continually pass through the laser material stimulating those atoms to emit more photons. This creates an ever increasing beam of photons all with the same characteristics all traveling in the same direction. In this way the optical cavity helps to amplify the original laser photons into concentrated intense beam of photons. The laser cavity also helps to narrow the frequency range of laser light emitted. The distance between the two mirrors defines the cavity mode which only allows light of narrow range of frequencies to continue being reflected back and forth. Light of other frequencies damped out. (This is just like in the chapter on the physics of music where pipe of certain length corresponds to particular wavelength of sound.) Therefore only narrow frequency of light can be emitted. In 1953 Charles H. Townes and graduate students James P. Gordon and Herbert J. Zeiger produced the first maser device operating on similar principles to the laser but producing microwave rather than optical radiation. Towness maser was incapable of making continuous beam. Nikolay Basov and Aleksandr Prokhorov of the former Soviet Union worked independently and developed method of making continuous beam using more than two energy levels. Townes Basov and Prokhorov shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1964. ,Laser consists of number of different parts that Work (physics) together to create the Laser beam.
