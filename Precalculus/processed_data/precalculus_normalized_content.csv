0,0,1,FUNDAMENTALS,1,In this first chapter we review the real numbers equations and the coordinate plane. You are probably already familiar with these concepts but it is help- ful to get fresh look at how these ideas work together to solve problems and model (or describe) real-world situations. Lets see how all these ideas are used in real-life situation: Suppose you get paid an hour at your part-time job. We can model your pay for working hours by the equation 9x To find out how many hours you need to work to get paid 200 dollars we solve the equation 200 9x Graphing the equation 9x in coordinate plane helps us see how pay increases with hours worked. ,Graph of a function|Plane (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Graph (mathematics)|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Universal quantification|Coordinate system|Coordinate system|Number|Basis (linear algebra)|Basis (linear algebra)|Real number|Work (physics)|Work (physics)|Work (physics)|Work (physics)
1,1,1.1,Real Numbers,2,Properties of Real Numbers Addition and Subtraction Multiplication and Division The Real Line Sets and Intervals Absolute Value and Distance Lets review the types of numbers that make up the real number system. We start with the natural numbers: The different types of real numbers were invented to meet specific needs. For example natural numbers are needed for counting negative num- bers for describing debt or below-zero temperatures rational numbers for concepts like half gallon of milk and irrational numbers for measuring certain distances like the diagonal of square. The integers consist of the natural numbers together with their negatives and 0: We construct the rational numbers by taking ratios of integers. Thus any rational num- ber can be expressed as where and are integers and 0. Examples are 37 46 461 17 0.17 100 (Recall that division by is always ruled out so expressions like 30 and 00 are undefined.) There are also real numbers such as 12 that cannot be expressed as ratio of integers and are therefore called irrational numbers. It can be shown with varying degrees of difficulty that these numbers are also irrational: 13 15 The set of all real numbers is usually denoted by the symbol When we use the word number without qualification we will mean real number. Figure is diagram of the types of real numbers that we work with in this book. Every real number has decimal representation. If the number is rational then its cor- responding decimal is repeating. For example 157 495 0.5000. 0.50 0.66666. 0.6 0.3171717. 0.317 1.285714285714. 1.285714 (The bar indicates that the sequence of digits repeats forever.) If the number is irrational the decimal representation is nonrepeating: 12 1.414213562373095. 3.141592653589793. If we stop the decimal expansion of any number at certain place we get an approxima- tion to the number. For instance we can write 3.14159265 where the symbol is read is approximately equal to. The more decimal places we re- tain the better our approximation. Properties of Real Numbers We all know that and and 513 87 87 513 and so on. In algebra we express all these (infinitely many) facts by writing where and stand for any two numbers. In other words is concise way of saying that when we add two numbers the order of addition doesnt matter. This fact is called the Commutative Property for addition. From our experience with numbers we know that the properties in the following box are also valid. The Distributive Property applies whenever we multiply number by sum. Figure explains why this property works for the case in which all the numbers are pos- itive integers but the property is true for any real numbers and c. Addition and Subtraction Dont assume that is negative number. Whether is negative or positive depends on the value of a. For example if then negative number but if then 15 (Property 2) pos- itive number. The number is special for addition it is called the additive identity because for any real number a. Every real number has negative that satisfies 1a Subtraction is the operation that undoes addition to subtract number from another we simply add the negative of that number. By definition 1b2 To combine real numbers involving negatives we use the following properties. Multiplication and Division The number is special for multiplication it is called the multiplicative identity because for any real number a. Every nonzero real number has an inverse 1a that satisfies 11a2 Division is the operation that undoes multiplication to divide by number we multiply by the inverse of that number. If then by definition We write 11b2 as simply ab. We refer to ab as the quotient of and or as the frac- When adding fractions with different denominators we dont usually use Property 4. Instead we rewrite the fractions so that they have the smallest possible common de- nominator (often smaller than the product of the denominators) and then we use Prop- erty 3. This denominator is the Least Common Denominator (LCD) described in the next example. The Real Line The real numbers can be represented by points on line as shown in Figure 3. The pos- itive direction (toward the right) is indicated by an arrow. We choose an arbitrary refer- ence point called the origin which corresponds to the real number 0. Given any con- venient unit of measurement each positive number is represented by the point on the line distance of units to the right of the origin and each negative number is repre- sented by the point units to the left of the origin. The number associated with the point is called the coordinate of and the line is then called coordinate line or real number line or simply real line. Often we identify the point with its coordinate and think of number as being point on the real line. Sets and Intervals set is collection of objects and these objects are called the elements of the set. If is set the notation means that is an element of and means that is not an element of S. For example if represents the set of integers then but Z. Some sets can be described by listing their elements within braces. For instance the set that consists of all positive integers less than can be written as 51 66 We could also write in set-builder notation as 5x is an integer and 76 which is read is the set of all such that is an integer and 7. If and are sets then their union is the set that consists of all elements that are in or (or in both). The intersection of and is the set consisting of all el- ements that are in both and T. In other words is the common part of and T. The empty set denoted by is the set that contains no element. Certain sets of real numbers called intervals occur frequently in calculus and corre- spond geometrically to line segments. If then the open interval from to con- sists of all numbers between and and is denoted 1a b2 The closed interval from to includes the endpoints and is denoted 3a b4 Using set-builder notation we can write 1a b2 5x b6 3a b4 5x b6 Note that parentheses in the interval notation and open circles on the graph in Figure indicate that endpoints are excluded from the interval whereas square brackets and solid circles in Figure indicate that the endpoints are included. Intervals may also include one endpoint but not the other or they may extend infinitely far in one direction or both. The following table lists the possible types of inter No Smallest or Largest Number in an Open Interval Any interval contains infinitely many numbersevery point on the graph of an interval corresponds to real num- ber. In the closed interval 30 the smallest number is and the largest is but the open interval 10 12 contains no smallest or largest number. To see this note that 0.01 is close to zero but 0.001 is closer 0.0001 is closer yet and so on. We can always find number in the interval 10 closer to zero than any given number. Since itself is not in the interval the interval contains no smallest number. Similarly 0.99 is close to but 0.999 is closer 0.9999 closer yet and so on. Since itself is not in the interval the interval has no largest number. Absolute Value and Distance |5 (1 NOW TRY EXERCISE 59 |3 3) 0.0001 The absolute value of number denoted by is the distance from to on the real number line (see Figure 9).

2,2,1.2,Exponents and Radicals,12,In this section we give meaning to expressions such as mn in which the exponent mn is rational number. To do this we need to recall some facts about integer exponents radi- cals and nth roots. Integer Exponents product of identical numbers is usually written in exponential notation. For example is written as In general we have the following definition. EXPONENTIAL NOTATION If is any real number and is positive integer then the nth power of is 1442443 factors The number is called the base and is called the exponent. We can state several useful rules for working with exponential notation. To discover the rule for multiplication we multiply by 21 42 1444244 43 123 1444442444443 factors factors factors It appears that to multiply two powers of the same base we add their exponents. In gen- eral for any real number and any positive integers and we have mn 144 4244 43 1442443 factors factors 144424443 factors Thus mn We would like this rule to be true even when and are or negative integers. For instance we must have 03 But this can happen only if 1. Likewise we want to have 142 44 and this will be true if 15 These observations lead to the following definition. Rules for Working with Exponents Familiarity with the following rules is essential for our work with exponents and bases. In the table the bases and are real numbers and the exponents and are integers. PROOF OF LAW If and are positive integers we have PROOF OF LAW If is positive integer we have Here we have used the Commutative and Associative Properties repeatedly. If Law can be proved by using the definition of negative exponents. When simplifying an expression you will find that many different methods will lead to the same result you should feel free to use any of the rules of exponents to arrive at your own method. We now give two additional laws that are useful in simplifying ex- pressions with negative exponents. Using the definition of negative exponents and then Property of fractions (page 5) we have Scientific Notation Scientists use exponential notation as compact way of writing very large numbers and very small numbers. For example the nearest star beyond the sun Proxima Centauri is approximately 40000000000000 km away. The mass of hydrogen atom is about 0.00000000000000000000000166 g. Such numbers are difficult to read and to write so scientists usually express them in scientific notation. SCIENTIFIC NOTATION positive number is said to be written in scientific notation if it is expressed as follows: Scientific notation is often used on calculator to display very large or very small number. For instance if we use calculator to square the number 1111111 the display panel may show (depending on the calculator model) the approximation 1.234568 12 or 1.23468 12 Here the final digits indicate the power of 10 and we interpret the result as 1.234568 10 12 Radicals We know what means whenever is an integer. To give meaning to power such as 45 whose exponent is rational number we need to discuss radicals. The symbol means the positive square root of. Thus Square roots are special cases of nth roots. The nth root of is the number that when raised to the nth power gives x. Rational Exponents To define what is meant by rational exponent or equivalently fractional exponent such as 13 we need to use radicals. To give meaning to the symbol 1n in way that is con- sistent with the Laws of Exponents we would have to have With this definition it can be proved that the Laws of Exponents also hold for rational exponents. Rationalizing the Denominator It is often useful to eliminate the radical in denominator by multiplying both numerator and denominator by an appropriate expression. This procedure is called rationalizing the denominator. If the denominator is of the form 1a we multiply numerator and denom- inator by 1a In doing this we multiply the given quantity by so we do not change its value. For instance 1a 1a 1a 1a 1a 1a Note that the denominator in the last fraction contains no radical. In general if the de- nominator is of the form with then multiplying the numerator and denomi- nm nator by will rationalize the denominator because (for 0) ,Mathematics|Subtraction|Commutative property|Associative property|Product topology|Identity (mathematics)|Square (algebra)|Square (algebra)|Square (algebra)|Mathematical proof|Mathematical proof|Mathematical proof|Mathematical proof|Natural number|Natural number|Natural number|Natural number|Base (exponentiation)|Base (exponentiation)|Base (exponentiation)|Base (exponentiation)|Sign (mathematics)|Sign (mathematics)|Sign (mathematics)|Sign (mathematics)|Sign (mathematics)|Sign (mathematics)|Sign (mathematics)|Sign (mathematics)|Sign (mathematics)|Sign (mathematics)|Universal quantification|Exponential function|Exponential function|Exponential function|Exponential function|Exponential function|Function (mathematics)|Square root|Square root|Rationalisation (mathematics)|Rationalisation (mathematics)|Rationalisation (mathematics)|Rationalisation (mathematics)|Rationalisation (mathematics)|Rationalisation (mathematics)|Rationalisation (mathematics)|Rationalisation (mathematics)|Nth root|Nth root|Nth root|Nth root|Nth root|Product (mathematics)|Rational number|Rational number|Position (vector)|Position (vector)|Position (vector)|Position (vector)|Position (vector)|Position (vector)|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Addition|Addition|Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Derivative|Real number|Real number|Real number|Work (physics)|Work (physics)|Work (physics)|Integer|Integer|Integer|Integer|Integer|Integer|Integer|Integer|Integer|Expression (mathematics)|Expression (mathematics)|Expression (mathematics)|Expression (mathematics)|Expression (mathematics)|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Scientific notation|Scientific notation|Scientific notation|Scientific notation|Scientific notation|Scientific notation|Scientific notation|Scientific notation|Scientific notation|Factorization|Factorization|Factorization|Factorization|Factorization|Factorization|Factorization|Homogeneous polynomial|Homogeneous polynomial|List of mathematical symbols|List of mathematical symbols
3,3,1.3,Algebraic Expressions,24,Adding and Subtracting Polynomials Multiplying Algebraic Expressions Special Product Formulas Factoring Common Factors Factoring Trinomials Special Factoring Formulas Factoring by Grouping Terms variable is letter that can represent any number from given set of numbers. If we start with variables such as and and some real numbers and combine them using addition subtraction multiplication division powers and roots we obtain an algebraic expression. Here are some examples: 2x 3x 1x 10 2z monomial is an expression of the form ax where is real number and is non- negative integer. binomial is sum of two monomials and trinomial is sum of three monomials. In general sum of monomials is called polynomial. For example the first expression listed above is polynomial but the other two are not. POLYNOMIALS polynomial in the variable is an expression of the form n1 n1 where are real numbers and is nonnegative integer. If then the polynomial has degree n. The monomials that make up the poly- nomial are called the terms of the polynomial. Note that the degree of polynomial is the highest power of the variable that appears in the polynomial. Adding and Subtracting Polynomials Distributive Property ac bc 1a b2c We add and subtract polynomials using the properties of real numbers that were dis- cussed in Section 1.1. The idea is to combine like terms (that is terms with the same vari- ables raised to the same powers) using the Distributive Property. For instance 5x 3x 15 32x 8x In subtracting polynomials we have to remember that if minus sign precedes an ex- pression in parentheses then the sign of every term within the parentheses is changed when we remove the parentheses: 1b c2 This is simply case of the Distributive Property a1b c2 ab ac with 1. Multiplying Algebraic Expressions To find the product of polynomials or other algebraic expressions we need to use the Distributive Property repeatedly. In particular using it three times on the product of two binomials we get The acronym FOIL helps us remember that the product of two binomials is the sum of the products of the First terms the Outer terms the Inner terms and the Last terms. 1a b2 1c d2 a1c d2 b1c d2 ac ad bc bd This says that we multiply the two factors by multiplying each term in one factor by each term in the other factor and adding these products. Schematically we have When we multiply trinomials or other polynomials with more terms we use the Dis- tributive Property. It is also helpful to arrange our work in table form. The next example illustrates both methods. Special Product Formulas Certain types of products occur so frequently that you should memorize them. You can verify the following formulas by performing the multiplications. The key idea in using these formulas (or any other formula in algebra) is the Principle of Substitution: We may substitute any algebraic expression for any letter in formula. For example to find 1x we use Product Formula substituting for and for to get Factoring Common Factors We use the Distributive Property to expand algebraic expressions. We sometimes need to reverse this process (again using the Distributive Property) by factoring an expression as product of simpler ones. For example we can write Factoring Trinomials To factor trinomial of the form bx we note that 1x 1x 1r 2x rs so we need to choose numbers and so that and rs c. ,Mathematics|Subtraction|Subtraction|Subtraction|Subtraction|Subtraction|Algebra|Algebra|Algebra|Algebra|Algebra|Algebra|Algebra|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Binomial|Binomial|Binomial|Monomial|Monomial|Monomial|Monomial|Monomial|Natural number|Sum|Sum|Sum|Sum|Summation|Summation|Summation|Summation|System of linear equations|Polynomial|Polynomial|Polynomial|Polynomial|Polynomial|Polynomial|Polynomial|Polynomial|Polynomial|Polynomial|Polynomial|Polynomial|Polynomial|Polynomial|Set (mathematics)|Sign (mathematics)|Sign (mathematics)|Sign (mathematics)|Sign (mathematics)|Algebraic expression|Algebraic expression|Algebraic expression|Algebraic expression|Algebraic expression|Algebraic expression|Universal quantification|Exponential function|Nth root|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Addition|Addition|Absolute value|Absolute value|Formula|Formula|Formula|Formula|Formula|Formula|Formula|Formula|Real number|Real number|Real number|Real number|Work (physics)|Integer|Integer|Integer|Expression (mathematics)|Expression (mathematics)|Expression (mathematics)|Expression (mathematics)|Expression (mathematics)|Expression (mathematics)|Expression (mathematics)|Expression (mathematics)|Expression (mathematics)|Expression (mathematics)|Empty sum|Empty sum|Empty sum|Empty sum|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Factorization|Factorization|Factorization|Factorization|Factorization|Factorization|Factorization|Factorization|Factorization|Factorization|Factorization|Factorization|Factorization|Change of variables|Change of variables|Change of variables|Homogeneous polynomial|Homogeneous polynomial|Homogeneous polynomial|Homogeneous polynomial|Distributive property|Distributive property|Distributive property|Distributive property|Distributive property|Distributive property
4,4,1.4,Rational Expressions,35,The Domain of an Algebraic Expression Simplifying Rational Expressions Multiplying and Dividing Rational Expressions Adding and Subtracting Rational Expressions Compound Fractions Rationalizing the Denominator or the Numerator Avoiding Common Errors quotient of two algebraic expressions is called fractional expression. Here are some examples: 2x 1x rational expression is fractional expression where both the numerator and denomi- nator are polynomials. For example the following are rational expressions: 2x 5x In this section we learn how to perform algebraic operations on rational expressions. The Domain of an Algebraic Expression Expression 1x 1x Domain 5x 06 5x 06 5x 06 In general an algebraic expression may not be defined for all values of the variable. The domain of an algebraic expression is the set of real numbers that the variable is permitted to have. The table in the margin gives some basic expressions and their domains. implifying Rational Expressions To simplify rational expressions we factor both numerator and denominator and use the following property of fractions: AC BC This allows us to cancel common factors from the numerator and denominator. Multiplying and Dividing Rational Expressions To multiply rational expressions we use the following property of fractions: AC BD This says that to multiply two fractions we multiply their numerators and multiply their denominators. Adding and Subtracting Rational Expressions Avoid making the following error: To add or subtract rational expressions we first find common denominator and then use the following property of fractions: For instance if we let and then we see the error: Wrong Although any common denominator will work it is best to use the least common de- nominator (LCD) as explained in Section 1.1. The LCD is found by factoring each de- nominator and taking the product of the distinct factors using the highest power that ap- pears in any of the factors. Compound Fractions compound fraction is fraction in which the numerator the denominator or both are themselves fractional expressions. Rationalizing the Denominator or the Numerator If fraction has denominator of the form 1C we may rationalize the denomi- nator by multiplying numerator and denominator by the conjugate radical 1C This works because by Special Product Formula in Section 1.3 the product of the de- nominator and its conjugate radical does not contain radical: Avoiding Common Errors Dont make the mistake of applying properties of multiplication to the operation of addition. Many of the common errors in algebra involve doing just that. The following table states sev- eral properties of multiplication and illustrates the error in applying them to addition. To verify that the equations in the right-hand column are wrong simply substitute numbers for and and calculate each side. For example if we take and in the fourth error we find that the left-hand side is whereas the right-hand side is Since 14 the stated equation is wrong. You should similarly convince yourself of the error in each of the other equations.

5,5,1.5,Equations,44,Solving Linear Equations Solving Quadratic Equations Other Types of Equations An equation is statement that two mathematical expressions are equal. For example is an equation. Most equations that we study in algebra contain variables which are sym- bols (usually letters) that stand for numbers. In the equation is solution of the equation 4x 19 because substituting makes the equation true: 413 19 4x 19 the letter is the variable. We think of as the unknown in the equation and our goal is to find the value of that makes the equation true. The values of the unknown that make the equation true are called the solutions or roots of the equation and the process of find- ing the solutions is called solving the equation. Two equations with exactly the same solutions are called equivalent equations. To solve an equation we try to find simpler equivalent equation in which the variable stands alone on one side of the equal sign. Here are the properties that we use to solve an equation. (In these properties and stand for any algebraic expressions and the symbol means is equivalent to.) PROPERTIES OF EQUALIT Property Description 1. 2. CA CB (C 0) Adding the same quantity to both sides of an equation gives an equivalent equation. Multiplying both sides of an equation by the same nonzero quantity gives an equiv- alent equation. These properties require that you perform the same operation on both sides of an equa- tion when solving it. Thus if we say add when solving an equation that is just short way of saying add to each side of the equation. Solving Linear Equations The simplest type of equation is linear equation or first-degree equation which is an equation in which each term is either constant or nonzero multiple of the variable. LINEAR EQUATIONS linear equation in one variable is an equation equivalent to one of the form ax where and are real numbers and is the variable. Solving Quadratic Equations Linear equations are first-degree equations like 2x or 3x 2. Quadratic equations are second-degree equations like 2x or 2x 5x. Quadratic Equations 2x 3x 10 4x 13 16 QUADRATIC EQUATIONS quadratic equation is an equation of the form ax bx where and are real numbers with 0. Some quadratic equations can be solved by factoring and using the following basic prop- erty of real numbers. ZERO-PRODUCT PROPERT AB if and only if or As we saw in Example if quadratic equation is of the form 1x a2 then we can solve it by taking the square root of each side. In an equation of this form the left-hand side is perfect square: the square of linear expression in x. So if qua- dratic equation does not factor readily then we can solve it using the technique of com- pleting the square. This means that we add constant to an expression to make it per- fect square. For example to make 6x perfect square we must add since 6x 1x 32 COMPLETING THE SQUARE To make bx perfect square add the square of half the coefficient of x. This gives the perfect square bx Other Types of Equations So far we have learned how to solve linear and quadratic equations. Now we study other types of equations including those that involve higher powers fractional expressions and radicals. ,Mathematics|Algebra|Algebra|Continuous function|Identity (mathematics)|Square (algebra)|Square (algebra)|Square (algebra)|Square (algebra)|Square (algebra)|Square (algebra)|Square (algebra)|Square (algebra)|Square (algebra)|Square (algebra)|System of linear equations|System of linear equations|Operation (mathematics)|Sign (mathematics)|Algebraic expression|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Universal quantification|Square root|Nth root|Nth root|Equation solving|Equation solving|Equation solving|Equation solving|Equation solving|Number|Number|Number|Number|Multiplication|Multiplication|Addition|Addition|Addition|Addition|Addition|Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean|Quadratic equation|Quadratic equation|Quadratic equation|Quadratic equation|Quadratic equation|Quadratic equation|Quadratic equation|Quadratic equation|Quadratic equation|Absolute value|Linear equation|Linear equation|Linear equation|Linear equation|Linear equation|Linear equation|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Equality (mathematics)|Equality (mathematics)|Real number|Real number|Real number|Expression (mathematics)|Expression (mathematics)|Expression (mathematics)|Expression (mathematics)|Expression (mathematics)|Exponentiation|Factorization|Factorization|Change of variables|Homogeneous polynomial|Homogeneous polynomial|Homogeneous polynomial|Homogeneous polynomial|List of mathematical symbols|Equality|Equality

In this section we use equations as mathematical models to solve real-life problems. Making and Using Models We will use the following guidelines to help us set up equations that model situations de- scribed in words. To show how the guidelines can help you to set up equations we note them as we work each example in this section. GUIDELINES FOR MODELING WITH EQUATIONS 1. Identify the Variable. Identify the quantity that the problem asks you to find. This quantity can usually be determined by careful reading of the question that is posed at the end of the problem. Then introduce notation for the vari- able (call it or some other letter). 2. Translate from Words to Algebra. Read each sentence in the problem again and express all the quantities mentioned in the problem in terms of the variable you defined in Step 1. To organize this information it is sometimes helpful to draw diagram or make table 3. Set Up the Model. Find the crucial fact in the problem that gives relation- ship between the expressions you listed in Step 2. Set up an equation (or model that expresses this relationship. 4. Solve the Equation and Check Your Answer. Solve the equation check your an- swer and express it as sentence that answers the question posed in the problem. The following example illustrates how these guidelines are used to translate word problem into the language of algebra. Problems About Interest When you borrow money from bank or when bank borrows your money by keeping it for you in savings account the borrower in each case must pay for the privilege of us- ing the money. The fee that is paid is called interest The most basic type of interest is simple interest which is just an annual percentage of the total amount borrowed or de- posited. The amount of loan or deposit is called the principal P. The annual percentage paid for the use of this money is the interest rate r. We will use the variable to stand for the number of years that the money is on deposit and the variable to stand for the total interest earned. The following simple interest formula gives the amount of interest earned when principal is deposited for years at an interest rate r. Problems About Area or Length When we use algebra to model physical situation we must sometimes use basic formu- las from geometry. For example we may need formula for an area or perimeter or the formula that relates the sides of similar triangles or the Pythagorean Theorem. Most of these formulas are listed in the front endpapers of this book. The next two examples use these geometric formulas to solve some real-world problems. Problems About Mixtures Many real-world problems involve mixing different types of substances. For example construction workers may mix cement gravel and sand fruit juice from concentrate may involve mixing different types of juices. Problems involving mixtures and concentrations make use of the fact that if an amount of substance is dissolved in solution with vol- ume then the concentration of the substance is given by So if 10 of sugar is dissolved in of water then the sugar concentration is 105 gL. Solving mixture problem usually requires us to analyze the amount of the substance that is in the solution. When we solve for in this equation we see that CV. Note that in many mixture problems the concentration is expressed as percentage as in the next example. Problems About the Time Needed to Do Job When solving problem that involves determining how long it takes several workers to complete job we use the fact that if person or machine takes time units to complete the task then in one time unit the fraction of the task that has been completed is 1H. For example if worker takes hours to mow lawn then in hour the worker will mow 15 of the lawn. Problems About Distance Rate and Time The next example deals with distance rate (speed) and time. The formula to keep in mind here is distance rate time where the rate is either the constant speed or average speed of moving object. For ex- ample driving at 60 mih for hours takes you distance of 60 240 mi. ,Triangle|Mathematics|Subtraction|Subtraction|Algebra|Algebra|Algebra|Algebra|Algebra|Pythagorean theorem|Set (mathematics)|Set (mathematics)|Set (mathematics)|Set (mathematics)|Length|Length|Sign (mathematics)|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Universal quantification|Exponential function|Function (mathematics)|Position (vector)|Number|Arithmetic mean|Determinant|Determinant|Derivative|Derivative|Formula|Formula|Formula|Formula|Formula|Formula|Work (physics)|Expression (mathematics)|Expression (mathematics)|Expression (mathematics)|Expression (mathematics)|Expression (mathematics)|Distance|Distance|Distance|Distance|Distance|Geometry|Geometry|Scientific notation|Area|Area|Area
7,7,1.7,Inequalities,73,Solving Linear Inequalities Solving Nonlinear Inequalities Absolute Value Inequalities Modeling with Inequalities Some problems in algebra lead to inequalities instead of equations. An inequality looks just like an equation except that in the place of the equal sign is one of the symbols or Here is an example of an inequality: 4x 19 4x 19 11 19 15 19 19 19 23 19 27 19 The table in the margin shows that some numbers satisfy the inequality and some num- bers dont. To solve an inequality that contains variable means to find all values of the variable that make the inequality true. Unlike an equation an inequality generally has infinitely many solutions which form an interval or union of intervals on the real line. The following illustration shows how an inequality differs from its corresponding equation: Solution Graph Equation: 19 Inequality: 19 To solve inequalities we use the following rules to isolate the variable on one side of the inequality sign. These rules tell us when two inequalities are equivalent (the symbol means is equivalent to). In these rules the symbols and stand for real num- bers or algebraic expressions. Here we state the rules for inequalities involving the sym- bol but they apply to all four inequality symbols. RULES FOR INEQUALITIES Rule Description 1. Adding the same quantity to each side of an inequality gives an equivalent inequality. 2. Subtracting the same quantity from each side of an inequal- ity gives an equivalent inequality. 3. If then CA CB Multiplying each side of an inequality by the same positive quantity gives an equivalent inequality. 4. If then CA CB Multiplying each side of an inequality by the same negative quantity reverses the direction of the inequality. 5. If and then 6. If and then Taking reciprocals of each side of an inequality involving positive quantities reverses the direction of the inequality. Inequalities can be added. Solving Linear Inequalities An inequality is linear if each term is constant or multiple of the variable. To solve linear inequality we isolate the variable on one side of the inequality sign. Solving Nonlinear Inequalities To solve inequalities involving squares and other powers of the variable we use factoring together with the following principle. THE SIGN OF PRODUCT OR QUOTIENT If product or quotient has an even number of negative factors then its value is positive. If product or quotient has an odd number of negative factors then its value is negative. For example to solve the inequality 5x we first move all terms to the left- hand side and factor to get 1x 22 1x 32 This form of the inequality says that the product 1x 22 1x 32 must be negative or zero so to solve the inequality we must determine where each factor is negative or positive (be- cause the sign of product depends on the sign of the factors). The details are explained in Example in which we use the following guidelines. GUIDELINES FOR SOLVING NONLINEAR INEQUALITIES 1. Move All Terms to One Side. If necessary rewrite the inequality so that all nonzero terms appear on one side of the inequality sign. If the nonzero side of the inequality involves quotients bring them to common denominator. 2. Factor. Factor the nonzero side of the inequality. 3. Find the Intervals. Determine the values for which each factor is zero. These numbers will divide the real line into intervals. List the intervals that are determined by these numbers. 4. Make Table or Diagram. Use test values to make table or diagram of the signs of each factor on each interval. In the last row of the table determine the sign of the product (or quotient) of these factors. 5. Solve. Determine the solution of the inequality from the last row of the sign table. Be sure to check whether the inequality is satisfied by some or all of the endpoints of the intervals. (This may happen if the inequality involves or .) The factoring technique that is described in these guidelines works only if all nonzero terms appear on one side of the inequality symbol. If the inequality is not written in this form first rewrite it as indicated in Step 1. Absolute Value Inequalities We use the following properties to solve inequalities that involve absolute value. These properties can be proved using the definition of absolute value. To prove Property for example note that the inequality says that the distance from to is less than and from Figure you can see that this is true if and only if is between and c.

8,8,1.8,Coordinate Geometry,83,The Coordinate Plane The Distance and Midpoint Formulas Graphs of Equations in Two Variables Intercepts Circles Symmetry The coordinate plane is the link between algebra and geometry. In the coordinate plane we can draw graphs of algebraic equations. The graphs in turn allow us to see the relation- ship between the variables in the equation. In this section we study the coordinate plane. The Coordinate Plane The Cartesian plane is named in honor of the French mathematician Ren Descartes (15961650) although another Frenchman Pierre Fermat (16011665) also invented the princi- ples of coordinate geometry at the same time. (See their biographies on pages 181 and 99.) Just as points on line can be identified with real numbers to form the coordinate line points in plane can be identified with ordered pairs of numbers to form the coordi- nate plane or Cartesian plane. To do this we draw two perpendicular real lines that intersect at on each line. Usually one line is horizontal with positive direction to the right and is called the x-axis the other line is vertical with positive direction upward and is called the y-axis. The point of intersection of the x-axis and the y-axis is the origin and the two axes divide the plane into four quadrants labeled II III and IV in Figure 1. (The points on the coordinate axes are not assigned to any quadrant.) Any point in the coordinate plane can be located by unique ordered pair of num- bers 1a b2 as shown in Figure 1. The first number is called the x-coordinate of the second number is called the y-coordinate of P. We can think of the coordinates of as its address because they specify its location in the plane. Several points are labeled with their coordinates in Figure 2. The Distance and Midpoint Formulas S. Temple St. 4th South St. 9th South St. 13th South St. 21st South St. 17th South St. We now find formula for the distance d1A B2 between two points A1x and B1x in the plane. Recall from Section 1.1 that the distance between points and on num- ber line is d1a b2 So from Figure we see that the distance between the points A1x and C1x on horizontal line must be and the distance be- tween B1x and C1x on vertical line must be B(x y) Post Office 1760 2100 (A A(x y) y-y C(x y) x-x FIGURE Since triangle ABC is right triangle the Pythagorean Theorem gives d1A B2 21x 1y DISTANCE FORMULA The distance between the points A1x and B1x in the plane is Now lets find the coordinates 1x of the midpoint of the line segment that joins the point A1x to the point B1x In Figure notice that triangles APM and MQB are congruent because d1A M2 d1M B2 and the corresponding angles are equal. FIGURE B(x y) Midpoint M(x y) x-x A(x y) x-x FIGURE It follows that d1A P2 d1M Q2 so Solving this equation for we get 2x so Similarly MIDPOINT FORMULA The midpoint of the line segment from A1x to B1x is EXAMPLE Applying the Midpoint Formula Show that the quadrilateral with vertices P11 22 Q14 42 R15 92 and S12 72 is paral- lelogram by proving that its two diagonals bisect each other. Graphs of Equations in Two Variables Fundamental Principle of Analytic Geometry point 1x y2 lies on the graph of an equation if and only if its coordinates satisfy the equation. An equation in two variables such as expresses relationship between two quantities. point 1x y2 satisfies the equation if it makes the equation true when the values for and are substituted into the equation. For example the point 13 102 satisfies the equa- tion because 10 but the point 11 32 does not because 1. THE GRAPH OF AN EQUATION The graph of an equation in and is the set of all points 1x in the coordi- nate plane that satisfy the equation. The graph of an equation is curve so to graph an equation we plot as many points as we can then connect them by smooth curve. Intercepts The x-coordinates of the points where graph intersects the x-axis are called the x-intercepts of the graph and are obtained by setting in the equation of the graph. The y-coordinates of the points where graph intersects the y-axis are called the y-intercepts of the graph and are obtained by setting in the equation of the graph. Circles P(x y) C(h k) FIGURE 12 So far we have discussed how to find the graph of an equation in and y. The converse problem is to find an equation of graph that is an equation that represents given curve in the xy-plane. Such an equation is satisfied by the coordinates of the points on the curve and by no other point. This is the other half of the fundamental principle of analytic geom- etry as formulated by Descartes and Fermat. The idea is that if geometric curve can be represented by an algebraic equation then the rules of algebra can be used to analyze the curve. As an example of this type of problem lets find the equation of circle with radius and center 1h k2 By definition the circle is the set of all points P1x y2 whose dis- tance from the center C1h is (see Figure 12). Thus is on the circle if and only if d1P C2 From the distance formula we have 21x h2 1y 1x h2 1y k2 Square each side This is the desired equation. EQUATION OF CIRCLE An equation of the circle with center 1h and radius is 1x h2 1y This is called the standard form for the equation of the circle. If the center of the circle is the origin 10 02 then the equation is EXAMPLE Graphing Circle Symmetry Figure 17 shows the graph of Notice that the part of the graph to the left of the y-axis is the mirror image of the part to the right of the y-axis. The reason is that if the point 1x is on the graph then so is 1x y2 and these points are reflections of each other about the y-axis. In this situation we say that the graph is symmetric with respect to the y-axis. Similarly we say that graph is symmetric with respect to the x- axis if whenever the point 1x y2 is on the graph then so is 1x graph is symmet- ric with respect to the origin if whenever 1x y2 is on the graph so is 1x y2 DEFINITION OF SYMMETRY Type of symmetry How to test for symmetry Symmetry with respect to the x-axis The equation is unchanged when is replaced by What the graph looks like

9,9,1.9,Graphing Calculators - Solving Equations and Inequalities Graphically,96,Using Graphing Calculator Solving Equations Graphically Solving Inequalities Graphically In Sections 1.5 and 1.7 we solved equations and inequalities algebraically. In Section 1.8 we learned how to sketch the graph of an equation in coordinate plane. In this section we use graphs to solve equations and inequalities. To do this we must first draw graph using graphing device. So we begin by giving few guidelines to help us use graphing devices effectively. Using Graphing Calculator (a d) yd xa (a c) (b d) xb yc (b c) The viewing rectangle 3a b4 by 3c graphing calculator or computer displays rectangular portion of the graph of an equa- tion in display window or viewing screen which we call viewing rectangle. The de- fault screen often gives an incomplete or misleading picture so it is important to choose the viewing rectangle with care. If we choose the x-values to range from minimum value of Xmin to maximum value of Xmax and the y-values to range from mini- mum value of Ymin to maximum value of Ymax then the displayed portion of the graph lies in the rectangle 3a b4 3c d4 51x y2 d6 as shown in Figure 1. We refer to this as the 3a b4 by 3c d4 viewing rectangle. The graphing device draws the graph of an equation much as you would. It plots points of the form 1x for certain number of values of equally spaced between and b. If the equation is not defined for an x-value or if the corresponding y-value lies outside the viewing rectangle the device ignores this value and moves on to the next x-value. The machine connects each point to the preceding plotted point to form representation of the graph of the equation. Solving Equations Graphically In Section 1.5 we learned how to solve equations. To solve an equation such as 3x we used the algebraic method. This means that we used the rules of algebra to isolate on one side of the equation. We view as an unknown and we use the rules of algebra to hunt it down. Here are the steps in the solution: 3x 3x So the solution is Add Divide by We can also solve this equation by the graphical method. In this method we view as variable and sketch the graph of the equation 3x Different values for give different values for y. Our goal is to find the value of for which 0. From the graph in Figure we see that when 1.7. Thus the so- lution is 1.7. Note that from the graph we obtain an approximate solution. We sum- marize these methods in the box below. The advantage of the algebraic method is that it gives exact answers. Also the process of unraveling the equation to arrive at the answer helps us to understand the algebraic structure of the equation. On the other hand for many equations it is difficult or impossi- ble to isolate x. The graphical method gives numerical approximation to the answer. This is an advan- tage when numerical answer is desired. (For example an engineer might find an answer expressed as 2.6 more immediately useful than 17 .) Also graphing an equation helps us to visualize how the solution is related to other values of the variable. Solving Inequalities Graphically Inequalities can be solved graphically. To describe the method we solve 10 5x This inequality was solved algebraically in Example of Section 1.7. To solve the in- equality graphically we draw the graph of 5x 5x Our goal is to find those values of for which 0. These are simply the x-values for which the graph lies below the x-axis. From Figure 11 we see that the solution of the in- equality is the interval 32 34. ,Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Plane (geometry)|Rectangle|Rectangle|Rectangle|Rectangle|Rectangle|Rectangle|Rectangle|Inequality (mathematics)|Inequality (mathematics)|Inequality (mathematics)|Inequality (mathematics)|Inequality (mathematics)|Inequality (mathematics)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Subtraction|Subtraction|Algebra|Algebra|Algebra|Algebra|Algebra|Algebra|Algebra|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Maxima and minima|Maxima and minima|Maxima and minima|Sum|Summation|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Division (mathematics)|Interval (mathematics)|Division by zero|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Coordinate system|Equation solving|Equation solving|Equation solving|Equation solving|Equation solving|Equation solving|Number|Addition|Arithmetic mean|Derivative|Derivative|Equality (mathematics)|Equality (mathematics)|Equality (mathematics)|Basis (linear algebra)|Expression (mathematics)|Empty sum|Range (mathematics)|Range (mathematics)|Homogeneous polynomial|Homogeneous polynomial|Equality|Equality|Equality
10,10,1.10,Lines,106,The Slope of Line Point-Slope Form of the Equation of Line Slope- Intercept Form of the Equation of Line Vertical and Horizontal Lines General Equation of Line Parallel and Perpendicular Lines Modeling with Linear Equations: Slope as Rate of Change In this section we find equations for straight lines lying in coordinate plane. The equa- tions will depend on how the line is inclined so we begin by discussing the concept of slope. The Slope of Line We first need way to measure the steepness of line or how quickly it rises (or falls) as we move from left to right. We define run to be the distance we move to the right and rise to be the corresponding distance that the line rises (or falls). The slope of line is the ratio of rise to run: slope rise run Figure shows situations in which slope is important. Carpenters use the term pitch for the slope of roof or staircase the term grade is used for the slope of road. If line lies in coordinate plane then the run is the change in the x-coordinate and the rise is the corresponding change in the y-coordinate between any two points on the line (see Figure 2). This gives us the following definition of slope. The slope is independent of which two points are chosen on the line. We can see that this is true from the similar triangles in Figure 3: B(x y) y-y (rise) A(x y) B(x y) x-x (run) y-y A(x y) x-x FIGURE Figure shows several lines labeled with their slopes. Notice that lines with positive slope slant upward to the right whereas lines with negative slope slant downward to the right. The steepest lines are those for which the absolute value of the slope is the largest horizontal line has slope zero. Point-Slope Form of the Equation of Line (x y) Rise P(x y) Run FIGURE Now lets find the equation of the line that passes through given point P1x and has slope m. point P1x y2 with lies on this line if and only if the slope of the line through and is equal to (see Figure 6) that is This equation can be rewritten in the form m1x note that the equation is also satisfied when and Therefore it is an equation of the given line. POINT-SLOPE FORM OF THE EQUATION OF LINE An equation of the line that passes through the point 1x and has slope is m1x Slope-Intercept Form of the Equation of Line Suppose nonvertical line has slope and y-intercept (see Figure 8). This means that the line intersects the y-axis at the point 10 b2 so the point-slope form of the equation of the line with and becomes (0 b) ymx+b m1x 02 This simplifies to mx which is called the slope-intercept form of the equation of line. FIGURE SLOPE-INTERCEPT FORM OF THE EQUATION OF LINE An equation of the line that has slope and y-intercept is mx Vertical and Horizontal Lines If line is horizontal its slope is so its equation is where is the y-intercept (see Figure 9). vertical line does not have slope but we can write its equa- tion as where is the x-intercept because the x-coordinate of every point on the line is a. General Equation of Line linear equation is an equation of the form Ax By where and are constants and and are not both 0. The equation of line is linear equation: nonvertical line has the equation mx or mx which is linear equation with and b. vertical line has the equation or which is linear equation with and a. Conversely the graph of linear equation is line. If the equation becomes Divide by and this is the slope-intercept form of the equation of line (with AB and CB). If the equation becomes Ax Set or CA which represents vertical line. We have proved the following. Parallel and Perpendicular Lines Since slope measures the steepness of line it seems reasonable that parallel lines should have the same slope. In fact we can prove this. PARALLEL LINES Two nonvertical lines are parallel if and only if they have the same slope. Modeling with Linear Equations: Slope as Rate of Change When line is used to model the relationship between two quantities the slope of the line is the rate of change of one quantity with respect to the other. For example the graph in Figure 17(a) on the next page gives the amount of gas in tank that is being filled. The slope between the indicated points is gallons galmin ,Triangle|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Plane (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Dependent and independent variables|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Mathematical proof|Mathematical proof|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Division (mathematics)|Slope|Slope|Slope|Slope|Slope|Slope|Slope|Slope|Slope|Slope|Slope|Slope|Slope|Slope|Slope|Slope|Slope|Slope|Slope|Slope|Slope|Slope|Slope|Slope|Slope|Slope|Slope|Slope|Slope|Slope|Slope|Slope|Slope|Zero of a function|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|System of linear equations|System of linear equations|System of linear equations|System of linear equations|Set (mathematics)|Division by zero|Sign (mathematics)|Sign (mathematics)|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Zero (complex analysis)|Coordinate system|Coordinate system|Position (vector)|Arithmetic mean|Absolute value|Absolute value|Linear equation|Linear equation|Linear equation|Linear equation|Linear equation|Linear equation|Linear equation|Linear equation|Linear equation|Linear equation|Linear equation|Linear equation|Linear equation|Linear equation|Linear equation|Linear equation|Linear equation|Equality (mathematics)|Parallel (geometry)|Parallel (geometry)|Parallel (geometry)|Parallel (geometry)|Parallel (geometry)|Basis (linear algebra)|Basis (linear algebra)|Distance|Distance|Homogeneous polynomial|Homogeneous polynomial|Homogeneous polynomial|Homogeneous polynomial|Homogeneous polynomial|Homogeneous polynomial|Homogeneous polynomial|Homogeneous polynomial|Homogeneous polynomial|Homogeneous polynomial|Homogeneous polynomial|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line–line intersection|Equality
11,11,1.11,Making Models Using Variation,118,Direct Variation Inverse Variation Joint Variation When scientists talk about mathematical model for real-world phenomenon they of- ten mean an equation that describes the relationship between two quantities. For instance the model might describe how the population of an animal species varies with time or how the pressure of gas varies as its temperature changes. In this section we study kind of modeling called variation. Direct Variation Two types of mathematical models occur so often that they are given special names. The first is called direct variation and occurs when one quantity is constant multiple of the other so we use an equation of the form kx to model this dependence. DIRECT VARIATION ykx (k0) If the quantities and are related by an equation kx for some constant we say that varies directly as or is directly pro- portional to or simply is proportional to x. The constant is called the con- stant of proportionality. FIGURE Recall that the graph of an equation of the form mx is line with slope and y-intercept b. So the graph of an equation kx that describes direct variation is line with slope and y-intercept (see Figure 1). Inverse Variation Another equation that is frequently used in mathematical modeling is kx where is constant. INVERSE VARIATION If the quantities and are related by the equation (k0) for some constant we say that is inversely proportional to or varies inversely as x. The constant is called the constant of proportionality. Inverse variation The graph of kx for is shown in Figure for the case 0. It gives picture of what happens when is inversely proportional to x. Joint Variation physical quantity often depends on more than one other quantity. If one quantity is pro- portional to two or more other quantities we call this relationship joint variation. JOINT VARIATION If the quantities and are related by the equation kxy where is nonzero constant we say that varies jointly as and or is jointly proportional to and y. In the sciences relationships between three or more variables are common and any combination of the different types of proportionality that we have discussed is possible. For example if we say that is proportional to and inversely proportional to y. ,Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Inequality (mathematics)|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Subtraction|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Slope|Slope|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Existential quantification|Existential quantification|Multiplication|Arithmetic mean|Derivative|Homogeneous polynomial|Homogeneous polynomial|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)
12,12,2,FUNCTIONS,141,Perhaps the most useful idea for modeling the real world is the concept of function. Lets look at an example. If rock climber drops stone from high cliff we know that the stone will fall. But this general description doesnt help us figure out when the stone will hit the ground. To find out we need rule that relates the distance the stone falls to the time it has been falling. Galileo was the first to discover the rule: In seconds the stone falls 16t feet. This rule is called function we write this function as d1t 16t Using this function model we can predict when the stone will hit the ground. In this chapter we study properties of functions and how function models can help us to get precise information about the thing or process being modeled. ,Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Real number|Distance
13,13,2.1,What Is a Function?,142,"Functions All Around Us Definition of Function Evaluating Function Domain of Function Four Ways to Represent Function In this section we explore the idea of function and then give the mathematical definition of function. Functions All Around Us In nearly every physical phenomenon we observe that one quantity depends on another. For example your height depends on your age the temperature depends on the date the cost of mailing package depends on its weight (see Figure 1). We use the term function to describe this dependence of one quantity on another. That is we say the following: Height is function of age. Temperature is function of date. Cost of mailing package is function of weight. The U.S. Post Office uses simple rule to determine the cost of mailing first-class par- cel on the basis of its weight. But its not so easy to describe the rule that relates height to age or the rule that relates temperature to date. Can you think of other functions? Here are some more examples: The area of circle is function of its radius. The number of bacteria in culture is function of time. The weight of an astronaut is function of her elevation. The price of commodity is function of the demand for that commodity. The rule that describes how the area of circle depends on its radius is given by the formula pr Even when precise rule or formula describing function is not available we can still describe the function by graph. For example when you turn on hot water faucet the temperature of the water depends on how long the water has been running. So we can say: The temperature of water from the faucet is function of time. Figure shows rough graph of the temperature of the water as function of the time that has elapsed since the faucet was turned on. The graph shows that the initial temper- ature of the water is close to room temperature. When the water from the hot water tank reaches the faucet the waters temperature increases quickly. In the next phase is con- stant at the temperature of the water in the tank. When the tank is drained decreases to the temperature of the cold water supply. Definition of Function We have previously used letters to stand for numbers. Here we do some- thing quite different: We use letters to represent rules. function is rule. To talk about function we need to give it name. We will use let- ters such as to represent functions. For example we can use the letter to rep- resent rule as follows: is the rule square the number When we write 122 we mean apply the rule to the number 2. Applying the rule gives 122 4. Similarly 132 f142 16 and in general 1x2 DEFINITION OF FUNCTION function is rule that assigns to each element in set exactly one element called 1x2 in set B. The key on your calculator is good example of function as ma- chine. First you input into the display. Then you press the key labeled (On most graphing calculators the or- der of these operations is reversed.) If then is not in the domain of this function that is is not an accept- able input and the calculator will indi- cate an error. If then an approxi- mation to 1x appears in the display correct to certain number of decimal places. (Thus the key on your cal- culator is not quite the same as the ex- act mathematical function defined by f1x 1x .) We usually consider functions for which the sets and are sets of real numbers. The symbol f1x is read of or at and is called the value of at or the image of under The set is called the domain of the function. The range of is the set of all possible values of 1x as varies throughout the domain that is range of 5f1x2 A6 The symbol that represents an arbitrary number in the domain of function is called an independent variable. The symbol that represents number in the range of is called dependent variable. So if we write f1x2 then is the independent variable and is the dependent variable. It is helpful to think of function as machine (see Figure 3). If is in the domain of the function then when enters the machine it is accepted as an input and the machine produces an output 1x2 according to the rule of the function. Thus we can think of the domain as the set of all possible inputs and the range as the set of all possible outputs. Machine diagram of output input Another way to picture function is by an arrow diagram as in Figure 4. Each arrow connects an element of to an element of B. The arrow indicates that 1x is associated with f1a2 is associated with and so on. Evaluating Function In the definition of function the independent variable plays the role of placeholder. For example the function 1x 3x can be thought of as """" """" """" To evaluate at number we substitute the number for the placeholder. The Domain of Function Recall that the domain of function is the set of all inputs for the function. The domain of function may be stated explicitly. For example if we write f1x2 Domains of algebraic expressions are discussed on page 35. then the domain is the set of all real numbers for which 5. If the function is given by an algebraic expression and the domain is not stated explicitly then by conven- tion the domain of the function is the domain of the algebraic expressionthat is the set of all real numbers for which the expression is defined as real number. For example consider the functions f1x g1x2 1x The function is not defined at so its domain is 5x 46 The function is not defined for negative so its domain is 5x 06 Four Ways to Represent Function To help us understand what function is we have used machine and arrow diagrams. We can describe specific function in the following four ways: verbally (by description in words) algebraically (by an explicit formula) visually (by graph) numerically (by table of values) single function may be represented in all four ways and it is often useful to go from one representation to another to gain insight into the function. However certain functions are described more naturally by one method than by the others. An example of verbal description is the following rule for converting between temperature scales: To find the Fahrenheit equivalent of Celsius temperature multiply the Celsius temperature by 95 then add 32. In Example we see how to describe this verbal rule or function algebraically graphi- cally and numerically. useful representation of the area of circle as function of its radius is the algebraic formula A1r2 pr The graph produced by seismograph (see the box on the next page) is visual repre- sentation of the vertical acceleration function a1t of the ground during an earthquake. As final example consider the function C1 which is described verbally as the cost of mailing first-class letter with weight The most convenient way of describing this function is numericallythat is using table of values. We will be using all four representations of functions throughout this book. We sum- marize them in the following box.

14,14,2.2,Graphs of Functions,152,Graphing Functions by Plotting Points Graphing Functions with Graphing Calculator Graphing Piecewise Defined Functions The Vertical Line Test Equations That Define Functions The most important way to visualize function is through its graph. In this section we in- vestigate in more detail the concept of graphing functions. Graphing Functions by Plotting Points To graph function we plot the points 1x f1x22 in coordinate plane. In other words we plot the points 1x y2 whose x-coordinate is an input and whose y-coordinate is the cor- responding output of the function. THE GRAPH OF FUNCTION If is function with domain then the graph of is the set of ordered pairs 51x f1x22 A6 plotted in coordinate plane. In other words the graph of is the set of all points 1x y2 such that f1x2 that is the graph of is the graph of the equation f1x2 f(1) f(2) The height of the graph above the point is the value of 1x The graph of function gives picture of the behavior or life history of the func- tion. We can read the value of f1x from the graph as being the height of the graph above the point (see Figure 1). function of the form f1x2 mx is called linear function because its graph is the graph of the equation mx which represents line with slope and y-intercept b. special case of linear function occurs when the slope is 0. The func- tion 1x2 where is given number is called constant function because all its val- ues are the same number namely b. Its graph is the horizontal line b. Figure shows the graphs of the constant function 1x2 and the linear function 1x2 2x 1. Graphing Functions with Graphing Calculator convenient way to graph function is to use graphing calculator. Because the graph of function is the graph of the equation 1x we can use the methods of Section Graphing Piecewise Defined Functions piecewise defined function is defined by different formulas on different parts of its do- main. As you might expect the graph of such function consists of separate pieces. The Vertical Line Test The graph of function is curve in the xy-plane. But the question arises: Which curves in the xy-plane are graphs of functions? This is answered by the following test. THE VERTICAL LINE TEST curve in the coordinate plane is the graph of function if and only if no verti- cal line intersects the curve more than once. We can see from Figure 10 why the Vertical Line Test is true. If each vertical line intersects curve only once at 1a b2 then exactly one functional value is defined by f1a2 b. But if line intersects the curve twice at 1a b2 and at 1a c2 then the curve cannot represent function because function cannot assign two different values to a. Equations That Define Functions Any equation in the variables and defines relationship between these variables. For example the equation defines relationship between and x. Does this equation define as function of x? To find out we solve for and get We see that the equation defines rule or function that gives one value of for each value of x. We can express this rule in function notation as 1x2 But not every equation defines as function of as the following example shows.

15,15,2.3,Getting Information from the Graph of a Function,163,Values of Function Domain and Range Increasing and Decreasing Functions Local Maximum and Minimum Values of Function Many properties of function are more easily obtained from graph than from the rule that describes the function. We will see in this section how graph tells us whether the values of function are increasing or decreasing and also where the maximum and mini- mum values of function are. Values of Function Domain and Range complete graph of function contains all the information about function because the graph tells us which input values correspond to which output values. To analyze the graph of function we must keep in mind that the height of the graph is the value of the func- tion. So we can read off the values of function from its graph. Increasing and Decreasing Functions It is very useful to know where the graph of function rises and where it falls. The graph shown in Figure rises falls then rises again as we move from left to right: It rises from to falls from to and rises again from to D. The function is said to be in- creasing when its graph rises and decreasing when its graph falls. is increasing We have the following definition. DEFINITION OF INCREASING AND DECREASING FUNCTIONS is increasing on an interval if f1x f1x whenever in I. is decreasing on an interval if f1x f1x whenever in I. Local Maximum and Minimum Values of Function Finding the largest or smallest values of function is important in many applications. For example if function represents revenue or profit then we are interested in its maximum value. For function that represents cost we would want to find its minimum value. (See Focus on Modeling: Modeling with Functions on pages 213222 for many such exam- ples.) We can easily find these values from the graph of function. We first define what we mean by local maximum or minimum. LOCAL MAXIMA AND MINIMA OF FUNCTION 1. The function value 1a2 is local maximum value of if 1a2 1x2 when is near 1a2 1x2 when is near (This means that 1a2 1x2 for all in some open interval containing a.) In this case we say that has local maximum at a. 2. The function value 1a2 is local minimum of if (This means that 1a2 1x2 for all in some open interval containing a.) In this case we say that has local minimum at a. Local maximum Local maximum We can find the local maximum and minimum values of function using graphing calculator. If there is viewing rectangle such that the point 1a f1a 22 is the highest point on the graph of within the viewing rectangle (not on the edge) then the number 1a2 is local maximum value of (see Figure 8). Notice that 1a2 f1x for all numbers that are close to a. ,Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Rectangle|Rectangle|Focus (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Domain of a function|Domain of a function|Open set|Open set|Closed set|Maxima and minima|Maxima and minima|Maxima and minima|Maxima and minima|Maxima and minima|Maxima and minima|Maxima and minima|Maxima and minima|Maxima and minima|Maxima and minima|Maxima and minima|Maxima and minima|Maxima and minima|Maxima and minima|Maxima and minima|Maxima and minima|Maxima and minima|Maxima and minima|Maxima and minima|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Interval (mathematics)|Interval (mathematics)|Interval (mathematics)|Interval (mathematics)|Universal quantification|Universal quantification|Universal quantification|Universal quantification|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Number|Number|Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean|Range (mathematics)|Range (mathematics)|Edge
16,16,2.4,Average Rate of Change of a Function,172,Average Rate of Change Linear Functions Have Constant Rate of Change Functions are often used to model changing quantities. In this section we learn how to find the rate at which the values of function change as the input variable changes. Average Rate of Change We are all familiar with the concept of speed: If you drive distance of 120 miles in hours then your average speed or rate of travel is 120 mi 60 mih Now suppose you take car trip and record the distance that you travel every few minutes. The distance you have traveled is function of the time t: 1t total distance traveled at time We graph the function as shown in Figure 1. The graph shows that you have traveled total of 50 miles after hour 75 miles after hours 140 miles after hours and so on. To find your average speed between any two points on the trip we divide the distance traveled by the time elapsed. The average speed that we have just calculated can be expressed by using function notation: average speed s142 s112 200 50 50 mih Note that the average speed is different over different time intervals. For example be- tween 2:00 and 3:00 we find that average speed s132 s122 140 75 65 mih Finding average rates of change is important in many contexts. For instance we might be interested in knowing how quickly the air temperature is dropping as storm approaches or how fast revenues are increasing from the sale of new product. So we need to know how to determine the average rate of change of the functions that model these quantities. In fact the concept of average rate of change can be defined for any function. AVERAGE RATE OF CHANGE The average rate of change of the function f1x2 between and is average rate of change f1b2 f1a2 change in change in The average rate of change is the slope of the secant line between and on the graph of that is the line that passes through 1a f1a22 and 1b 1b22 Linear Functions Have Constant Rate of Change For linear function f1x mx the average rate of change between any two points is the same constant m. This agrees with what we learned in Section 1.10: that the slope of line mx is the average rate of change of with respect to x. On the other hand if function has constant average rate of change then it must be linear function. You are asked to prove this fact in Exercise 33. In the next example we find the average rate of change for particular linear function. ,Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Dependent and independent variables|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Subtraction|Subtraction|Product topology|Mathematical proof|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Division (mathematics)|Slope|Slope|Interval (mathematics)|Universal quantification|Universal quantification|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Multiplication|Secant line|Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean|Determinant|Derivative|Derivative|Expression (mathematics)|Linear function|Linear function|Linear function|Linear function|Linear function|Distance|Distance|Distance|Distance|Distance|Scientific notation|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)
17,17,2.5,Transformations of Functions,179,Vertical Shifting Horizontal Shifting Reflecting Graphs Vertical Stretching and Shrinking Horizontal Stretching and Shrinking Even and Odd Functions In this section we study how certain transformations of function affect its graph. This will give us better understanding of how to graph functions. The transformations that we study are shifting reflecting and stretching. Vertical Shifting Recall that the graph of the function is the same as the graph of the equation 1x2 Adding constant to function shifts its graph vertically: upward if the constant is posi- tive and downward if it is negative. In general suppose we know the graph of f1x2 How do we obtain from it the graphs of f1x2 and f1x2 1c 02 The y-coordinate of each point on the graph of f1x2 is units above the y-coordinate of the corresponding point on the graph of f1x So we obtain the graph of f1x2 simply by shifting the graph of f1x2 upward units. Similarly we obtain the graph of f1x2 by shifting the graph of 1x2 downward units. VERTICAL SHIFTS OF GRAPHS Suppose 0. To graph f1x2 shift the graph of f1x2 upward units. To graph f1x2 shift the graph of f1x2 downward units. Horizontal Shifting Suppose that we know the graph of f1x How do we use it to obtain the graphs of f1x c2 and f1x c2 1c 02 The value of 1x c2 at is the same as the value of f1x2 at c. Since is units shifted to the right units. Similar reasoning shows that the graph of f1x c2 is the graph of f1x2 shifted to the left units. The following box summarizes these facts. HORIZONTAL SHIFTS OF GRAPHS Suppose 0. To graph f1x c2 shift the graph of f1x2 to the right units. To graph f1x c2 shift the graph of f1x2 to the left units. Reflecting Graphs Suppose we know the graph of f1x2 How do we use it to obtain the graphs of f1x2 and f1x2 The y-coordinate of each point on the graph of 1x2 is simply the negative of the y-coordinate of the corresponding point on the graph of f1x2 So the desired graph is the reflection of the graph of f1x2 in the x-axis. On the other hand the value of f1x at is the same as the value of f1x at so the desired graph here is the reflection of the graph of f1x2 in the y-axis. The fol- lowing box summarizes these observations. REFLECTING GRAPHS To graph f1x2 reflect the graph of f1x2 in the x-axis. To graph f1x2 reflect the graph of f1x2 in the y-axis. Vertical Stretching and Shrinking Suppose we know the graph of f1x2 How do we use it to obtain the graph of cf1x2 The y-coordinate of cf1x2 at is the same as the corresponding y-coordinate of f1x2 multiplied by c. Multiplying the y-coordinates by has the ef- fect of vertically stretching or shrinking the graph by factor of c. VERTICAL STRETCHING AND SHRINKING OF GRAPHS To graph cf1x2 If stretch the graph of f1x2 vertically by factor of c. If shrink the graph of f1x2 vertically by factor of c. Horizontal Stretching and Shrinking Now we consider horizontal shrinking and stretching of graphs. If we know the graph of f1x2 then how is the graph of f1cx related to it? The y-coordinate of f1cx at is the same as the y-coordinate of f1x2 at cx. Thus the x-coordinates in the graph of f1x2 correspond to the x-coordinates in the graph of f1cx multiplied by c. Looking at this the other way around we see that the x-coordinates in the graph of f1cx are the x-coordinates in the graph of f1x2 multiplied by 1c. In other words to change the graph of f1x2 to the graph of f1cx we must shrink (or stretch) the graph horizontally by factor of 1c as summarized in the following box. HORIZONTAL SHRINKING AND STRETCHING OF GRAPHS To graph f1cx If shrink the graph of f1x2 horizontally by factor of 1c. If stretch the graph of f1x2 horizontally by factor of 1c. Even and Odd Functions If function satisfies f1x2 f1x2 for every number in its domain then is called an even function For instance the function f1x2 is even because f1x 1x2 112 f1x The graph of an even function is symmetric with respect to the y-axis (see Figure 11). This means that if we have plotted the graph of for then we can obtain the entire graph simply by reflecting this portion in the y-axis. If satisfies f1x 1x2 for every number in its domain then is called an odd function For example the function f1x2 is odd because f1x2 1x2 112 f1x The graph of an odd function is symmetric about the origin (see Figure 12). If we have plotted the graph of for then we can obtain the entire graph by rotating this por- tion through 180 about the origin. (This is equivalent to reflecting first in the x-axis and then in the y-axis.) ,Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Mathematics|Dependent and independent variables|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Domain of a function|Domain of a function|Rotation (mathematics)|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Sign (mathematics)|Sign (mathematics)|Equation|Universal quantification|Universal quantification|Origin (mathematics)|Origin (mathematics)|Symmetry|Symmetry|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Even and odd functions|Even and odd functions|Even and odd functions|Even and odd functions|Even and odd functions|Even and odd functions|Number|Number|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Arithmetic mean|Transformation (function)|Transformation (function)|Factorization|Factorization|Factorization|Factorization|Factorization|Factorization|Parity (mathematics)|Parity (mathematics)
18,18,2.6,Combining Functions,190,Sums Differences Products and Quotients Composition of Functions In this section we study different ways to combine functions to make new functions. Sums Differences Products and Quotients The sum of and is defined by 1f g2 1x2 f1x2 g1x The name of the new function is g. So this sign stands for the operation of addition of functions. The sign on the right side however stands for addition of the numbers f1x2 and g1x2 Two functions and can be combined to form new functions fg and fg in manner similar to the way we add subtract multiply and divide real numbers. For example we define the function by 1f g2 1x f1x2 g1x2 The new function is called the sum of the functions and its value at is f1x2 g1x2 Of course the sum on the right-hand side makes sense only if both f1x2 and g1x2 are defined that is if belongs to the domain of and also to the domain of g. So if the domain of is and the domain of is then the domain of is the intersec- tion of these domains that is Similarly we can define the difference the product fg and the quotient fg of the functions and g. Their domains are but in the case of the quotient we must remember not to divide by 0. Composition of Functions Now lets consider very important way of combining two functions to get new func- tion. Suppose f1x2 1x and g1x2 We may define new function as h1x2 f1g1x22 f1x 12 2x The function is made up of the functions and in an interesting way: Given number we first apply the function to it then apply to the result. In this case is the rule take the square root is the rule square then add and is the rule square then add then take the square root. In other words we get the rule by applying the rule and then the rule f. Figure shows machine diagram for h. input +1 +1 output The machine is composed of the machine (first) and then the machine. In general given any two functions and we start with number in the domain of and find its image g1x2 If this number g1x is in the domain of we can then calculate the value of f1g1x22 The result is new function h1x f1g1x22 that is obtained by sub- stituting into f. It is called the composition (or composite) of and and is denoted by (f composed with g). Copyright 2010 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

19,19,2.7,One-to-One Functions and Their Inverses,199,One-to-One Functions The Inverse of Function Graphing the Inverse of Function The inverse of function is rule that acts on the output of the function and produces the corresponding input. So the inverse undoes or reverses what the function has done. Not all functions have inverses those that do are called one-to-one. One-to-One Functions Lets compare the functions and whose arrow diagrams are shown in Figure 1. Note that never takes on the same value twice (any two numbers in have different images) whereas does take on the same value twice (both and have the same image 4). In symbols g122 g132 but f1x f1x whenever Functions that have this latter property are called one-to-one. DEFINITION OF ONE-TO-ONE FUNCTION function with domain is called one-to-one function if no two elements of have the same image that is f1x f1x whenever An equivalent way of writing the condition for one-to-one function is this: f(x) If 1x 1x then f(x) This function is not one-to-one because 1x 1x If horizontal line intersects the graph of at more than one point then we see from Fig- ure that there are numbers such that f1x f1x This means that is not one- to-one. Therefore we have the following geometric method for determining whether function is one-to-one. HORIZONTAL LINE TEST function is one-to-one if and only if no horizontal line intersects its graph more than once. The Inverse of Function One-to-one functions are important because they are precisely the functions that possess inverse functions according to the following definition. DEFINITION OF THE INVERSE OF FUNCTION Let be one-to-one function with domain and range B. Then its inverse func- tion has domain and range and is defined by 1y2 for any in B. 1x2 This definition says that if takes to then takes back to x. (If were not one- to-one then would not be defined uniquely.) The arrow diagram in Figure indicates that reverses the effect of f. From the definition we have domain of range of range of domain of INVERSE FUNCTION PROPERT Let be one-to-one function with domain and range B. The inverse function satisfies the following cancellation properties: 1f1x22 for every in f1f 1x 22 for every in Conversely any function satisfying these equations is the inverse of f. Graphing the Inverse of Function The principle of interchanging and to find the inverse function also gives us method for obtaining the graph of from the graph of f. If f1a2 then 1b2 Thus the point 1a b2 is on the graph of if and only if the point 1b a2 is on the graph of But we get the point 1b a2 from the point 1a b2 by reflecting in the line (see Figure on the next page). Therefore as Figure on the next page illustrates the following is true. The graph of is obtained by reflecting the graph of in the line x. ,Injective function|Injective function|Injective function|Injective function|Injective function|Injective function|Injective function|Injective function|Injective function|Injective function|Injective function|Injective function|Injective function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Inequality (mathematics)|Inequality (mathematics)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Subtraction|Domain of a function|Domain of a function|Domain of a function|Domain of a function|Domain of a function|Domain of a function|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Equation|Universal quantification|Universal quantification|Universal quantification|Universal quantification|Image (mathematics)|Image (mathematics)|Image (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Number|Number|Arithmetic mean|Determinant|Derivative|Derivative|Derivative|Derivative|Geometry|Range (mathematics)|Range (mathematics)|Range (mathematics)|Range (mathematics)|Range (mathematics)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line–line intersection|Line–line intersection|List of mathematical symbols
20,20,3,POLYNOMIAL AND RATIONAL FUNCTIONS,223,Functions defined by polynomial expressions are called polynomial functions. The graphs of polynomial functions can have many peaks and valleys this makes them suitable models for many real-world situations. For example factory owner notices that if she increases the number of workers productivity increases but if there are too many workers productivity begins to decrease. This situation is modeled by polynomial function of degree (a quadratic function). As another example when volleyball is hit it goes up and then down following path that is also modeled by quadratic function.The graphs of polynomial functions are smooth curves that are used in designing many things.

21,21,3.1,Quadratic Functions and Models,224,"Graphing Quadratic Functions Using the Standard Form Maximum and Minimum Values of Quadratic Functions Modeling with Quadratic Functions polynomial function is function that is defined by polynomial expression. So poly- nomial function of degree is function of the form P1x2 n""1 n""1 Polynomial expressions are defined in Section 1.3. We have already studied polynomial functions of degree and 1. These are functions of the form P1x2 and P1x2 respectively whose graphs are lines. In this section we study polynomial functions of degree 2. These are called quadratic functions. QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS quadratic function is polynomial function of degree 2. So quadratic func- tion is function of the form f1x2 ax bx We see in this section how quadratic functions model many real-world phenomena. We begin by analyzing the graphs of quadratic functions. Graphing Quadratic Functions Using the Standard Form For geometric definition of parabolas see Section 11.1. If we take and in the quadratic function f1x ax bx we get the quadratic function 1x2 whose graph is the parabola graphed in Example of Section 2.2. In fact the graph of any quadratic function is parabola it can be obtained from the graph of f1x by the transformations given in Section 2.5. STANDARD FORM OF QUADRATIC FUNCTION quadratic function f1x2 ax bx can be expressed in the standard form 1x2 a1x h2 by completing the square. The graph of is parabola with vertex 1h the parabola opens upward if or downward if 0. Vertex (h k) Vertex (h k) a(x-h)TM+k a0 Maximum and Minimum Values of Quadratic Functions If quadratic function has vertex 1h k2 then the function has minimum value at the ver- tex if its graph opens upward and maximum value at the vertex if its graph opens down- ward. For example the function graphed in Figure has minimum value when since the vertex 13 52 is the lowest point on the graph. MAXIMUM OR MINIMUM VALUE OF QUADRATIC FUNCTION Let be quadratic function with standard form f1x2 a1x h2 The maximum or minimum value of occurs at h. If then the minimum value of is f1h2 k. If then the maximum value of is 1h2 k.

22,22,3.2,Polynomial Functions and Their Graphs,232,"Graphing Basic Polynomial Functions End Behavior and the Leading Term Using Zeros to Graph Polynomials Shape of the Graph Near Zero Local Maxima and Minima of Polynomials In this section we study polynomial functions of any degree. But before we work with polynomial functions we must agree on some terminology. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS polynomial function of degree is function of the form P1x2 n""1 n""1 where is nonnegative integer and The numbers are called the coefficients of the polynomial. The number is the constant coefficient or constant term. The number the coefficient of the highest power is the leading coefficient and the term is the leading term. We often refer to polynomial functions simply as polynomials. The following polyno- mial has degree leading coefficient and constant term ""6. Graphing Basic Polynomial Functions The graphs of polynomials of degree or are lines (Section 1.10) and the graphs of polynomials of degree are parabolas (Section 3.1). The greater the degree of polyno- mial the more complicated its graph can be. However the graph of polynomial func- tion is continuous. This means that the graph has no breaks or holes (see Figure 1). More- over the graph of polynomial function is smooth curve that is it has no corners or sharp points (cusps) as shown in Figure 1. Continuous functions are studied in Section 13.2 page 851. cusp hole break smooth and continuous smooth and continuous corner Not the graph of polynomial function Not the graph of polynomial function Graph of polynomial function Graph of polynomial function FIGURE The simplest polynomial functions are the monomials P1x whose graphs are shown in Figure 2. As the figure suggests the graph of P1x2 has the same general shape as the graph of when is even and the same general shape as the graph of when is odd. However as the degree becomes larger the graphs become flat- ter around the origin and steeper elsewhere. End Behavior and the Leading Term The end behavior of polynomial is description of what happens as becomes large in the positive or negative direction. To describe end behavior we use the following notation: ""q means becomes large in the positive direction means becomes large in the negative direction For example the monomial in Figure 2(b) has the following end behavior: as and as ""q The monomial in Figure 2(c) has the following end behavior: as and ""q as ""q For any polynomial the end behavior is determined by the term that contains the highest power of because when is large the other terms are relatively insignificant in size. The following box shows the four possible types of end behavior based on the highest power and the sign of its coefficient. END BEHAVIOR OF POLYNOMIALS The end behavior of the polynomial P1x2 n""1 n""1 is determined by the degree and the sign of the leading coefficient as indicated in the following graphs. Using Zeros to Graph Polynomials If is polynomial function then is called zero of if P1c2 In other words the zeros of are the solutions of the polynomial equation P1x2 Note that if P1c2 then the graph of has an x-intercept at so the x-intercepts of the graph are the zeros of the function. REAL ZEROS OF POLYNOMIALS If is polynomial and is real number then the following are equivalent: 1. is zero of P. 2. is solution of the equation P1x2 3. is factor of P1x2 4. is an x-intercept of the graph of P. To find the zeros of polynomial we factor and then use the Zero-Product Property (see page 47). For example to find the zeros of P1x2 we factor to get P1x2 1x 22 1x 32 From this factored form we easily see that 1. 2. 3. 4. is zero of P. is solution of the equation 0. is factor of 6. is an x-intercept of the graph of P. The same facts are true for the other zero ""3. The following theorem has many important consequences. (See for instance the Discov- ery Project referenced on page 263.) Here we use it to help us graph polynomial functions. INTERMEDIATE VALUE THEOREM FOR POLYNOMIALS (b) yP (x) (a) FIGURE If is polynomial function and P1a2 and P1b2 have opposite signs then there exists at least one value between and for which P1c2 We will not prove this theorem but Figure shows why it is intuitively plausible. One important consequence of this theorem is that between any two successive zeros the values of polynomial are either all positive or all negative. That is between two suc- cessive zeros the graph of polynomial lies entirely above or entirely below the x-axis. To see why suppose and are successive zeros of P. If has both positive and negative values between and then by the Intermediate Value Theorem must have another zero between and But thats not possible because and are successive zeros. This observation allows us to use the following guidelines to graph polynomial functions. GUIDELINES FOR GRAPHING POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS Factor the polynomial to find all its real zeros these are the x-intercepts of the graph. 2. Test Points. Make table of values for the polynomial. Include test points to determine whether the graph of the polynomial lies above or below the x-axis on the intervals determined by the zeros. Include the y-intercept in the table. 1. Zeros. Determine the end behavior of the polynomial. 4. Graph. Plot the intercepts and other points you found in the table. Sketch smooth curve that passes through these points and exhibits the required end behavior. Shape of the Graph Near Zero Although is zero of the polynomial in Example the graph does not cross the x-axis at the x-intercept 2. This is because the factor 1x 22 corresponding to that zero is raised to an even power so it doesnt change sign as we test points on either side of 2. In the same way the graph does not cross the x-axis at in Example 6. In general if is zero of and the corresponding factor occurs exactly times in the factorization of then we say that is zero of multiplicity By considering test points on either side of the x-intercept we conclude that the graph crosses the x-axis at if the multiplicity is odd and does not cross the x-axis if is even. Moreover it can be shown by using calculus that near the graph has the same general shape as the graph of A1x c2 Local Maxima and Minima of Polynomials Recall from Section 2.3 that if the point 1a f1a22 is the highest point on the graph of within some viewing rectangle then f1a2 is local maximum value of and if 1b f1b22 is the lowest point on the graph of within viewing rectangle then f1b2 is local min- imum value (see Figure 12). We say that such point 1a f1a22 is local maximum point on the graph and that 1b f1b22 is local minimum point. The local maximum and min- imum points on the graph of function are called its local extrema. f(a) Local maximum point For polynomial function the number of local extrema must be less than the degree as the following principle indicates. (A proof of this principle requires calculus.) LOCAL EXTREMA OF POLYNOMIALS If P1x n""1 n""1 is polynomial of degree then the graph of has at most local extrema. polynomial of degree may in fact have less than local extrema. For exam- ple P1x (graphed in Figure 2) has no local extrema even though it is of degree 5. The preceding principle tells us only that polynomial of degree can have no more than local extrem ",Calculus|Calculus|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a

DIVISION ALGORITHM If P1x2 and D1x2 are polynomials with D1x2 then there exist unique polyno- mials Q1x2 and R1x2 where R1x2 is either or of degree less than the degree of D1x such that To write the division algorithm another way divide through by D1x2: P1x2 D1x2 Q1x2 P1x2 D1x2 Q1x R1x2 R1x D1x Dividend Divisor Remainder Quotient The polynomials P1x2 and D1x2 are called the dividend and divisor respectively Q1x2 is the quotient and R1x2 is the remainder. Synthetic Division Synthetic division is quick method of dividing polynomials it can be used when the divisor is of the form c. In synthetic division we write only the essential parts of the long division. Compare the following long and synthetic divisions in which we divide 2x 7x by 3. (Well explain how to perform the synthetic division in Example 3.)

(Writing instead of ""3 allows us to add instead of subtract but this changes the sign of all the numbers that appear in the gold boxes.) The next example shows how synthetic division is performed. The Remainder and Factor Theorems The next theorem shows how synthetic division can be used to evaluate polynomials easily.

24,24,3.4,Real Zeros of Polynomials,253,"Rational Zeros of Polynomials Descartes Rule of Signs and Upper and Lower Bounds for Roots Using Algebra and Graphing Devices to Solve Polynomial Equations The Factor Theorem tells us that finding the zeros of polynomial is really the same thing as factoring it into linear factors. In this section we study some algebraic methods that help us to find the real zeros of polynomial and thereby factor the polynomial. We be- gin with the rational zeros of polynomial.

Descartes Rule of Signs and Upper and Lower Bounds for Roots Polynomial Variations in sign 4x 2x 3x In some cases the following rulediscovered by the French philosopher and mathemati- cian Ren Descartes around 1637 (see page 181)is helpful in eliminating candidates from lengthy lists of possible rational roots. To describe this rule we need the concept of variation in sign. If P1x2 is polynomial with real coefficients written with descending powers of (and omitting powers with coefficient 0) then variation in sign occurs whenever adjacent coefficients have opposite signs. For example P1x2 5x 3x 2x has three variations in sign. DESCARTES RULE OF SIGNS Let be polynomial with real coefficients. 1. The number of positive real zeros of P1x2 either is equal to the number of vari- ations in sign in P1x2 or is less than that by an even whole number. 2. The number of negative real zeros of P1x2 either is equal to the number of variations in sign in P1""x or is less than that by an even whole number. THE UPPER AND LOWER BOUNDS THEOREM Let be polynomial with real coefficients. 1. If we divide P1x2 by (with 0) using synthetic division and if the row that contains the quotient and remainder has no negative entry then is an upper bound for the real zeros of P. 2. If we divide P1x2 by (with 0) using synthetic division and if the row that contains the quotient and remainder has entries that are alternately nonpos- itive and nonnegative then is lower bound for the real zeros of P. proof of this theorem is suggested in Exercise 97. The phrase alternately nonposi- tive and nonnegative simply means that the signs of the numbers alternate with con- sidered to be positive or negative as required.

26,26,3.6,Complex Zeros and the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra,269,"The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra and Complete Factorization Zeros and Their Multiplicities Complex Zeros Come in Conjugate Pairs Linear and Quadratic Factors We have already seen that an nth-degree polynomial can have at most real zeros. In the complex number system an nth-degree polynomial has exactly zeros and so can be fac- tored into exactly linear factors. This fact is consequence of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra which was proved by the German mathematician C. F. Gauss in 1799 (see page 272). The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra and Complete Factorization The following theorem is the basis for much of our work in factoring polynomials and solving polynomial equations. FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF ALGEBRA Every polynomial P1x2 n""1 n""1 with complex coefficients has at least one complex zero. 1n 02 Because any real number is also complex number the theorem applies to polynomi- als with real coefficients as well. The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra and the Factor Theorem together show that polynomial can be factored completely into linear factors as we now prove. COMPLETE FACTORIZATION THEOREM If P1x is polynomial of degree then there exist complex numbers (with 0) such that Zeros and Their Multiplicities In the Complete Factorization Theorem the numbers are the zeros of P. These zeros need not all be different. If the factor appears times in the complete factorization of P1x2 then we say that is zero of multiplicity (see page 240). For ex- ample the polynomial has the following zeros: P1x 1x 12 1x 22 1x 32 1multiplicity 32 ""2 1multiplicity 22 ""3 1multiplicity 52 The polynomial has the same number of zeros as its degree: It has degree 10 and has 10 zeros provided that we count multiplicities. This is true for all polynomials as we prove in the following theorem. ZEROS THEOREM Every polynomial of degree has exactly zeros provided that zero of multiplicity is counted times. Complex Zeros Come in Conjugate Pairs As you might have noticed from the examples so far the complex zeros of polynomials with real coefficients come in pairs. Whenever bi is zero its complex conjugate bi is also zero. CONJUGATE ZEROS THEOREM If the polynomial has real coefficients and if the complex number is zero of then its complex conjugate is also zero of P. Linear and Quadratic Factors We have seen that polynomial factors completely into linear factors if we use complex numbers. If we dont use complex numbers then polynomial with real coefficients can always be factored into linear and quadratic factors. We use this property in Section 10.7 when we study partial fractions. quadratic polynomial with no real zeros is called irre- ducible over the real numbers. Such polynomial cannot be factored without using com- plex numbers.

27,27,3.7,Rational Functions,277,"Rational Functions and Asymptotes Transformations of 1x Asymptotes of Rational Functions Graphing Rational Functions Slant Asymptotes and End Behavior Applications rational function is function of the form r1x2 P1x2 Q1x where and are polynomials. We assume that P1x2 and Q1x2 have no factor in com- mon. Even though rational functions are constructed from polynomials their graphs look quite different from the graphs of polynomial functions. Rational Functions and Asymptotes Domains of rational expressions are discussed in Section 1.4. The domain of rational function consists of all real numbers except those for which the denominator is zero. When graphing rational function we must pay special attention to the behavior of the graph near those x-values. We begin by graphing very simple ra- tional function. We describe this behavior in words and in symbols as follows. The first table shows that as approaches from the left the values of f1x2 decrease without bound. In symbols f1x2 ""q as approaches negative infinity as approaches from the left The second table shows that as approaches from the right the values of f1x2 increase without bound. In symbols f1x2 as approaches infinity as approaches from the right The next two tables show how f1x2 changes as becomes large. x22 ""10 ""100 ""100000 10 100 100000 ""0.1 ""0.01 ""0.00001 Approaching Approaching x22 0.1 0.01 0.00001 Approaching Approaching These tables show that as becomes large the value of f1x2 gets closer and closer to zero. We describe this situation in symbols by writing 1x2 as ""q and f1x2 as Using the information in these tables and plotting few additional points we obtain the graph shown in Figure 1. ""2 ""1 x22 ""1 ""2 f(x) as FIGURE f1x2 f(x) as f(x) as f(x) as The function is defined for all values of other than so the domain is 5x 06 From the graph we see that the range is 5y 06 NOW TRY EXERCISE In Example we used the following arrow notation. Symbol ""q Meaning approaches from the left approaches from the right goes to negative infinity that is decreases without bound goes to infinity that is increases without bound The line is called vertical asymptote of the graph in Figure and the line is horizontal asymptote. Informally speaking an asymptote of function is line to which the graph of the function gets closer and closer as one travels along that line. DEFINITION OF VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL ASYMPTOTES 1. The line is vertical asymptote of the function f1x2 if approaches as approaches from the right or left. as as as as 2. The line is horizontal asymptote of the function f1x2 if approaches as approaches q. as as rational function has vertical asymptotes where the function is undefined that is where the denominator is zero. Transformations of 1x rational function of the form r1x2 ax cx can be graphed by shifting stretching andor reflecting the graph of f1x2 shown in Figure using the transformations studied in Section 2.5. (Such functions are called lin- ear fractional transformations.) Asymptotes of Rational Functions The methods of Example work only for simple rational functions. To graph more com- plicated ones we need to take closer look at the behavior of rational function near its vertical and horizontal asymptotes. FINDING ASYMPTOTES OF RATIONAL FUNCTIONS Let be the rational function 1x2 n""1 n""1 m""1 m""1 1. The vertical asymptotes of are the lines where is zero of the denominator. 2. (a) If then has horizontal asymptote 0. (b) If then has horizontal asymptote (c) If then has no horizontal asymptote. Graphing Rational Functions We have seen that asymptotes are important when graphing rational functions. In general we use the following guidelines to graph rational functions. SKETCHING GRAPHS OF RATIONAL FUNCTIONS 1. Factor. fraction is if and only if its numer- ator is 0. Factor the numerator and denominator. 2. Intercepts. Find the x-intercepts by determining the zeros of the numerator and the y-intercept from the value of the function at 0. 3. Vertical Asymptotes. Find the vertical asymptotes by determining the zeros of the denominator and then see whether or ""q on each side of each vertical asymptote by using test values. 4. Horizontal Asymptote. Find the horizontal asymptote (if any) using the procedure described in the box on page 282. 5. Sketch the Graph. Graph the information provided by the first four steps. Then plot as many additional points as needed to fill in the rest of the graph of the function. Slant Asymptotes and End Behavior If r1x2 P1x 2Q1x2 is rational function in which the degree of the numerator is one more than the degree of the denominator we can use the Division Algorithm to express the function in the form R1x2 r1x ax Q1x2 where the degree of is less than the degree of and 0. This means that as R1x 2Q1x so for large values of the graph of 1x2 approaches the graph of the line ax b. In this situation we say that ax is slant asymp- tote or an oblique asymptote.

28,28,4,EXPONENTIAL AND LOGARITHMIC FUNCTIONS,301,In this chapter we study class of functions called exponential functions. These are functions like 1x where the independent variable is in the exponent. Exponential functions are used in modeling many real-world phe- nomena such as the growth of population or the growth of an investment that earns compound interest. Once an exponential model is obtained we can use the model to predict population size or calculate the amount of an invest- ment for any future date. To find out when population will reach certain level we use the inverse functions of exponential functions called logarithmic functions. So if we have an exponential model for population growth we can answer questions like: When will my city be as crowded as the New York City street pictured above? ,Dependent and independent variables|Logarithm|Graph (mathematics)|Universal quantification|Exponential function|Exponential function|Exponential function|Exponential function|Exponential function|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation
29,29,4.1,Exponential Functions,302,Exponential Functions Graphs of Exponential Functions Compound Interest In this chapter we study new class of functions called exponential functions. For example f1x2 is an exponential function (with base 2). Notice how quickly the values of this function increase: f132 f1102 10 1024 f1302 30 1073741824 Compare this with the function g1x2 where g1302 30 900 The point is that when the variable is in the exponent even small change in the variable can cause dra- matic change in the value of the function. Exponential Functions To study exponential functions we must first define what we mean by the exponential ex- pression when is any real number. In Section 1.2 we defined for and ra- tional number but we have not yet defined irrational powers. So what is meant by 13 or To define when is irrational we approximate by rational numbers. For example since 13 1.73205. is an irrational number we successively approximate 13 by the following rational powers: 1.7 1.73 1.732 1.7320 1.73205 Intuitively we can see that these rational powers of are getting closer and closer to 13 It can be shown by using advanced mathematics that there is exactly one number that these powers approach. We define 13 to be this number. For example using calculator we find 13 1.732 16.2411. The Laws of Exponents are listed on page 14. The more decimal places of 13 we use in our calculation the better our approximation of 13 It can be proved that the Laws of Exponents are still true when the exponents are real numbers. EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS The exponential function with base is defined for all real numbers by f1x2 where and We assume that because the function f1x2 is just constant function. Here are some examples of exponential functions: f1x2 Base g1x2 Base h1x2 10 Graphs of Exponential Functions We first graph exponential functions by plotting points. We will see that the graphs of such functions have an easily recognizable shape. Graphing Exponential Functions by Plotting Points GRAPHS OF EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS The exponential function f1x2 1a 12 has domain and range 10 The line (the x-axis) is horizontal as- ymptote of f. The graph of has one of the following shapes. (0 1) (0 1) for a1 for 0a1 Compound Interest Exponential functions occur in calculating compound interest. If an amount of money called the principal is invested at an interest rate per time period then after one time period the interest is Pi and the amount of money is Pi P11 i2 If the interest is reinvested then the new principal is P11 and the amount after an- other time period is P11 i2 11 i2 P11 Similarly after third time pe- riod the amount is P11 In general after periods the amount is P11 i2 Notice that this is an exponential function with base i. If the annual interest rate is and if interest is compounded times per year then in each time period the interest rate is rn and there are nt time periods in years. This leads to the following formula for the amount after years. COMPOUND INTEREST Compound interest is calculated by the formula where is often referred to as the nominal annual interest rate.

In this section we study the special base which is convenient for applications involving calculus. The Number The number is defined as the value that 11 1n2 approaches as becomes large. (In calculus this idea is made more precise through the concept of limit. See Chapter 13.) The table shows the values of the expression 11 1n2 for increasingly large values of n. 10 100 1000 10000 100000 1000000 The Gateway Arch in St.LouisMissouri is shaped in the form of the graph of combination of exponential functions (not parabolaas it might first appear). Specificallyit is catenarywhich is the graph of an equation of the form a1e bx bx (see Exercise 17).This shape was chosen because it is optimal for distributing the internal structural forces of the arch. Chains and cables suspended between two points (for example the stretches of cable between pairs of telephone poles) hang in the shape of catenary. 2.00000 2.48832 2.59374 2.70481 2.71692 2.71815 2.71827 2.71828 It appears that correct to five decimal places 2.71828 in fact the approximate value to 20 decimal places is 2.71828182845904523536 It can be shown that is an irrational number so we cannot write its exact value in deci- mal form. The Natural Exponential Function The notation was chosen by Leon- hard Euler (see page 266) probably because it is the first letter of the word exponential. The number is the base for the natural exponential function. Why use such strange base for an exponential function? It might seem at first that base such as 10 is easier to work with. We will see however that in certain applications the number is the best possible base. In this section we study how occurs in the description of compound interest. y3 y2 THE NATURAL EXPONENTIAL FUNCTION The natural exponential function is the exponential function f1x2 ye with base e. It is often referred to as the exponential function. Graph of the natural ex- ponential function Since the graph of the natural exponential function lies between the graphs of and as shown in Figure 1. Scientific calculators have special key for the function f1x2 We use this key in the next example. Continuously Compounded Interest In Example of Section 4.1 we saw that the interest paid increases as the number of com- pounding periods increases. Lets see what happens as increases indefinitely. If we let nr then A1t nt nr rt rt Recall that as becomes large the quantity 11 1m2 approaches the number e. Thus the amount approaches Pe rt This expression gives the amount when the interest is compounded at every instant.

31,31,4.3,Logarithmic Functions,315,Logarithmic Functions Graphs of Logarithmic Functions Common Logarithms Natural Logarithms In this section we study the inverses of exponential functions. f(x)a a1 1x is one-to-one. Logarithmic Functions Every exponential function f1x2 with and is one-to-one function by the Horizontal Line Test (see Figure for the case 1) and therefore has an inverse function. The inverse function is called the logarithmic function with base and is denoted by log Recall from Section 2.6 that is defined by 1x2 f1y2 This leads to the following definition of the logarithmic function. DEFINITION OF THE LOGARITHMIC FUNCTION Let be positive number with 1. The logarithmic function with base denoted by log is defined by We read log as log base of is y. By tradition the name of the logarith- mic function is log not just single letter. Also we usually omit the paren- theses in the function notation and write log So log is the exponent to which the base must be raised to give x. When we use the definition of logarithms to switch back and forth between the loga- rithmic form log and the exponential form it is helpful to notice that in both forms the base is the same: Logarithmic form log 1x log Exponent log Base Exponential form Graphs of Logarithmic Functions ylog yx Graph of the logarithmic function 1x2 log Recall that if one-to-one function has domain and range then its inverse function has domain and range A. Since the exponential function f1x2 with has domain and range 10 we conclude that its inverse function 1x2 log has domain 10 and range The graph of 1x2 log is obtained by reflecting the graph of f1x2 in the line x. Figure shows the case 1. The fact that (for 1) is very rapidly increasing function for implies that log is very slowly increasing function for (see Exercise 92). Since log the x-intercept of the function log is 1. The y-axis is vertical asymptote of log because log as Common Logarithms We now study logarithms with base 10. COMMON LOGARITHM The logarithm with base 10 is called the common logarithm and is denoted by omitting the base: log log 10 10 3.65629 10 4.76180 8.41809 10 261872564 The idea is that multiplying powers of 10 is easy (we simply add their expo- nents). Napier produced extensive ta- bles giving the logarithms (or expo- nents) of numbers. Since the advent of calculators and computers logarithms are no longer used for this purpose. The logarithmic functions however have found many applications some of which are described in this chapter. Napier wrote on many topics. One of his most colorful works is book enti- tled Plaine Discovery of the Whole Reve- lation of Saint John in which he pre- dicted that the world would end in the year 1700. From the definition of logarithms we can easily find that log 10 and log 100 But how do we find log 50? We need to find the exponent such that 10 50. Clearly is too small and is too large. So log 50 To get better approximation we can experiment to find power of 10 closer to 50. For- tunately scientific calculators are equipped with LOG key that directly gives values of common logarithms. Natural Logarithms The notation ln is an abbreviation for the Latin name logarithmus naturalis. Of all possible bases for logarithms it turns out that the most convenient choice for the purposes of calculus is the number which we defined in Section 4.2. NATURAL LOGARITHM ye The logarithm with base is called the natural logarithm and is denoted by ln ln log yln The natural logarithmic function ln is the inverse function of the natural expo- nential function Both functions are graphed in Figure 9. By the definition of in- verse functions we have ln yx Graph of the natural logarithmic function If we substitute and write ln for log in the properties of logarithms men- tioned earlier we obtain the following properties of natural logarithms.

32,32,4.4,Laws of Logarithms,325,Laws of Logarithms Expanding and Combining Logarithmic Expressions Change of Base Formula In this section we study properties of logarithms. These properties give logarithmic func- tions wide range of applications as we will see in Section 4.6. Laws of Logarithms Since logarithms are exponents the Laws of Exponents give rise to the Laws of Logarithms. LAWS OF LOGARITHMS Let be positive number with 1. Let and be any real numbers with and 0. Law 1. log 1AB log log 2. log log log 3. log 1A log Description The logarithm of product of numbers is the sum of the logarithms of the numbers. The logarithm of quotient of numbers is the difference of the logarithms of the numbers. The logarithm of power of number is the exponent times the logarithm of the number. Expanding and Combining Logarithmic Expressions The Laws of Logarithms allow us to write the logarithm of product or quotient as the sum or difference of logarithms. This process called expanding logarithmic expression is illustrated in the next example. Expanding Logarithmic Expressions Change of Base Formula For some purposes we find it useful to change from logarithms in one base to logarithms in another base. Suppose we are given log and want to find log x. Let log We write this in exponential form and take the logarithm with base of each side.

33,33,4.5,Exponential and Logarithmic Equations,331,xponential Equations Logarithmic Equations Compound Interest In this section we solve equations that involve exponential or logarithmic functions. The techniques that we develop here will be used in the next section for solving applied problems. Exponential Equations An exponential equation is one in which the variable occurs in the exponent. For example The variable presents difficulty because it is in the exponent. To deal with this difficulty we take the logarithm of each side and then use the Laws of Logarithms to bring down from the exponent. ln ln ln ln ln ln 2.807 Given equation Take ln of each side Law (bring down exponent) Solve for Calculator Recall that Law of the Laws of Logarithms says that log log A. The method that we used to solve is typical of how we solve exponential equa- tions in general. GUIDELINES FOR SOLVING EXPONENTIAL EQUATIONS 1. Isolate the exponential expression on one side of the equation. 2. Take the logarithm of each side then use the Laws of Logarithms to bring down the exponent. 3. Solve for the variable. Logarithmic Equations logarithmic equation is one in which logarithm of the variable occurs. For example log 1x 22 To solve for we write the equation in exponential form. Exponential form 32 30 Solve for Another way of looking at the first step is to raise the base to each side of the equation. log 1x&22 Raise to each side Property of logarithms 32 30 Solve for The method used to solve this simple problem is typical. We summarize the steps as follows. GUIDELINES FOR SOLVING LOGARITHMIC EQUATIONS 1. Isolate the logarithmic term on one side of the equation you might first need to combine the logarithmic terms. 2. Write the equation in exponential form (or raise the base to each side of the equation). 3. Solve for the variable. Compound Interest Recall the formulas for interest that we found in Section 4.1. If principal is invested at an interest rate for period of years then the amount of the investment is given by P11 r2 Simple interest (for one year) nt A1t A1t Pe rt Interest compounded times per year Interest compounded continuously We can use logarithms to determine the time it takes for the principal to increase to given amount. ,Common logarithm|Common logarithm|Common logarithm|Common logarithm|Continuous function|Logarithm|Logarithm|Logarithm|Logarithm|Logarithm|Logarithm|Logarithm|Logarithm|Logarithm|Logarithm|Logarithm|Logarithm|Logarithm|Logarithm|Logarithm|Logarithm|Logarithm|Logarithm|Logarithm|Natural logarithm|Natural logarithm|Natural logarithm|Natural logarithm|Natural logarithm|Natural logarithm|Natural logarithm|Base (exponentiation)|Base (exponentiation)|Binary logarithm|Binary logarithm|Binary logarithm|Binary logarithm|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Exponential function|Exponential function|Exponential function|Exponential function|Exponential function|Exponential function|Exponential function|Exponential function|Exponential function|Function (mathematics)|Equation solving|Determinant|Formula|Periodic function|Expression (mathematics)|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Homogeneous polynomial|Homogeneous polynomial|Homogeneous polynomial
34,34,4.6,Modeling with Exponential and Logarithmic Functions,340,Exponential Growth (Doubling Time) Exponential Growth (Relative Growth Rate) Radioactive Decay Newtons Law of Cooling Logarithmic Scales Many processes that occur in nature such as population growth radioactive decay heat diffusion and numerous others can be modeled by using exponential functions. Loga- rithmic functions are used in models for the loudness of sounds the intensity of earth- quakes and many other phenomena. In this section we study exponential and logarithmic models. Exponential Growth (Doubling Time) Suppose we start with single bacterium which divides every hour. After one hour we have bacteria after two hours we have or bacteria after three hours we have or bacteria and so on (see Figure 1). We see that we can model the bacteria population af- ter hours by 1t If we start with 10 of these bacteria then the population is modeled by 1t2 10 slower-growing strain of bacteria doubles every hours in this case the population is modeled by 1t 10 t3 In general we have the following. EXPONENTIAL GROWTH (DOUBLING TIME) If the intial size of population is and the doubling time is then the size of the population at time is n1t ta where and are measured in the same time units (minutes hours days years and so on). Exponential Growth (Relative Growth Rate) We have used an exponential function with base to model population growth (in terms of the doubling time). We could also model the same population with an exponential func- tion with base (in terms of the tripling time). In fact we can find an exponential model with any base. If we use the base we get the following model of population in terms of the relative growth rate r: the rate of population growth expressed as proportion of the population at any time. For instance if 0.02 then at any time the growth rate is of the population at time t. EXPONENTIAL GROWTH (RELATIVE GROWTH RATE) population that experiences exponential growth increases according to the model where n1t rt n1t population at time initial size of the population relative rate of growth (expressed as proportion of the population) time Notice that the formula for population growth is the same as that for continuously com- pounded interest. In fact the same principle is at work in both cases: The growth of pop- ulation (or an investment) per time period is proportional to the size of the population (or the amount of the investment). population of 1000000 will increase more in one year than population of 1000 in exactly the same way an investment of 1000000 will in- crease more in one year than an investment of 1000. In the following examples we assume that the populations grow exponentially. Radioactive Decay Radioactive substances decay by spontaneously emitting radiation. The rate of decay is proportional to the mass of the substance. This is analogous to population growth except that the mass decreases. Physicists express the rate of decay in terms of half-life. For ex- ample the half-life of radium-226 is 1600 years so 100-g sample decays to 50 1or 100 g2 in 1600 years then to 25 1or 100 g2 in 3200 years and so on. In general for radioactive substance with mass and half-life the amount remaining at time is modeled by m1t th where and are measured in the same time units (minutes hours days years and so on). To express this model in the form m1t rt we need to find the relative decay rate r. Since is the half-life we have m1t rt rh ln Model is the half-life rh Divide by rh Take ln of each side ln Solve for This last equation allows us to find the rate from the half-life h. RADIOACTIVE DECAY MODEL If is the initial mass of radioactive substance with half-life then the mass remaining at time is modeled by the function where ln m1t rt Newtons Law of Cooling Newtons Law of Cooling states that the rate at which an object cools is proportional to the temperature difference between the object and its surroundings provided that the tem- perature difference is not too large. By using calculus the following model can be de- duced from this law. NEWTONS LAW OF COOLING If is the initial temperature difference between an object and its surroundings and if its surroundings have temperature then the temperature of the object at time is modeled by the function T1t2 kt where is positive constant that depends on the type of object. Logarithmic Scales When physical quantity varies over very large range it is often convenient to take its logarithm in order to have more manageable set of numbers. We discuss three such situations: the pH scale which measures acidity the Richter scale which measures the intensity of earthquakes and the decibel scale which measures the loudness of sounds. Other quantities that are measured on logarithmic scales are light intensity information capacity and radiation. pH for Some Common Substances Substance pH Milk of magnesia Seawater Human blood Crackers Hominy Cows milk Spinach Tomatoes Oranges Apples Limes Battery acid 10.5 8.08.4 7.37.5 7.08.5 6.97.9 6.46.8 5.15.7 4.14.4 3.04.0 2.93.3 1.32.0 1.0 The pH Scale Chemists measured the acidity of solution by giving its hydrogen ion concentration until Sren Peter Lauritz Srensen in 1909 proposed more convenient measure. He defined pH log3H where 3H is the concentration of hydrogen ions measured in moles per liter (M). He did this to avoid very small numbers and negative exponents. For instance if 3H 10 then pH log 10 110 142 Solutions with pH of are defined as neutral those with pH are acidic and those with pH are basic.

35,35,5,TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS: UNIT CIRCLE APPROACH,369,If youve ever taken ferris wheel ride then you know about periodic motion that is motion that repeats over and over. Periodic motion is common in nature. Think about the daily rising and setting of the sun (day night day night .) the daily variation in tide levels (high low high low .) or the vibrations of leaf in the wind (left right left right .). To model such motion we need function whose values increase then decrease then increase and so on. To un- derstand how to define such function lets look at person riding on ferris wheel. The graph shows the height of the person above the center of the wheel at time t. Notice that the graph goes up and down repeatedly. The trigonometric function sine is defined in similar way using the unit cir- cle (in place of the ferris wheel). The trigonometric functions can be defined in two different but equivalent ways: as functions of real numbers (Chapter 5) or as functions of angles (Chapter 6). The two approaches are independent of each other so either Chapter or Chapter may be studied first. We study both ap- proaches because the different approaches are required for different applications. ,Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Sine|Subtraction|Subtraction|Subtraction|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Angle|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Set (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Number|Derivative|Derivative|Derivative|Real number|Periodic function|Periodic function
36,36,5.1,The Unit Circle,370,The Unit Circle Terminal Points on the Unit Curcle The Reference Number In this section we explore some properties of the circle of radius centered at the origin. These properties are used in the next section to define the trigonometric functions. The Unit Circle The set of points at distance from the origin is circle of radius (see Figure 1). In Section 1.8 we learned that the equation of this circle is 1. THE UNIT CIRCLE The unit circle is the circle of radius centered at the origin in the xy-plane. Its equation is The Reference Number From Examples and we see that to find terminal point in any quadrant we need only know the corresponding terminal point in the first quadrant. We use the idea of the ref- erence number to help us find terminal points. REFERENCE NUMBER Let be real number. The reference number associated with is the shortest distance along the unit circle between the terminal point determined by and the x-axis. USING REFERENCE NUMBERS TO FIND TERMINAL POINTS To find the terminal point determined by any value of we use the following steps: 1. Find the reference number 2. Find the terminal point Q1a b2 determined by 3. The terminal point determined by is P1a b2 where the signs are chosen according to the quadrant in which this terminal point lies. ,Unit circle|Unit circle|Unit circle|Unit circle|Unit circle|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Associative property|Trigonometric functions|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Circle|Set (mathematics)|Sign (mathematics)|Equation|Equation|Origin (mathematics)|Origin (mathematics)|Origin (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Radius|Radius|Radius|Trigonometry|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Determinant|Determinant|Determinant|Determinant|Real number|Distance|Distance|Quadrant (plane geometry)|Quadrant (plane geometry)|Quadrant (plane geometry)
37,37,5.2,Trigonometric Functions of Real Numbers,377,The Trigonometric Functions Values of the Trigonometric Functions Fundamental Identities function is rule that assigns to each real number another real number. In this section we use properties of the unit circle from the preceding section to define the trigonometric functions. The Trigonometric Functions (x y) Recall that to find the terminal point P1x for given real number we move distance along the unit circle starting at the point 11 02 We move in counterclockwise direction if is positive and in clockwise direction if is negative (see Figure 1). We now use the x- and y-coordinates of the point P1x to define several functions. For instance we define the function called sine by assigning to each real number the y-coordinate of the terminal point P1x y2 determined by t. The functions cosine tangent cosecant se- cant and cotangent are also defined by using the coordinates of P1x y2 DEFINITION OF THE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS FIGURE Let be any real number and let P1x y2 be the terminal point on the unit circle determined by t. We define sin csc cos 1y 02 sec 1x 02 tan cot 1x 02 1y 02 Because the trigonometric functions can be defined in terms of the unit circle they are sometimes called the circular functions. If you have previously studied trigonometry of right triangles (Chapter 6) you are probably won- dering how the sine and cosine of an angle relate to those of this section. To see how lets start with right triangle )OPQ. opp hyp adj OQ OQ hyp OP OP cos Now if is measured in radians then (see the figure). So the trigonometric functions of the angle with radian measure are exactly the same as the trigonometric functions defined in terms of the terminal point determined by the real number t. sin Place the triangle in the coordinate plane as shown with angle in standard position. P(x y) opp PQ hyp OP OP By the definition of the trigonometric functions of the real number we have adj Right triangle OPQ cos sin P(x y) P(x y) is the terminal point determined by t. The point 1x y2 in the figure is the terminal point determined by the arc t. Note that triangle OPQ is similar to the small triangle OP *Q* whose legs have lengths and y. Now by the definition of the trigonometric functions of the angle we have The radian measure of angle is t. Why then study trigonometry in two different ways? Because different applications require that we view the trigonometric functions differently. (Com- pare Section 5.6 with Sections 6.2 6.5 and 6.6.) DOMAINS OF THE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS Function sin cos Domain All real numbers tan sec All real numbers other than cot csc np for any integer All real numbers other than np for any integer Values of the Trigonometric Functions The following mnemonic device will help you remember which trigonometric functions are positive in each quadrant: All of them Sine Tangent or Cosine. ine SIGNS OF THE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS ll angent To compute other values of the trigonometric functions we first determine their signs. The signs of the trigonometric functions depend on the quadrant in which the terminal point of lies. For example if the terminal point P1x y2 determined by lies in Quadrant III then its coordinates are both negative. So sin cos csc and sec are all negative whereas tan and cot are positive. You can check the other entries in the following box. osine You can remember this as All Stu- dents Take Calculus. Quadrant Positive Functions Negative Functions all none II sin csc cos sec tan cot III tan cot sin csc cos sec IV cos sec sin csc tan cot For example cos12p3 because the terminal point of 2p3 is in Quadrant II whereas tan because the terminal point of is in Quadrant III. In Section 5.1 we used the reference number to find the terminal point determined by real number t. Since the trigonometric functions are defined in terms of the coordinates of terminal points we can use the reference number to find values of the trigonometric functions. Suppose that is the reference number for t. Then the terminal point of has the same coordinates except possibly for sign as the terminal point of t. So the values of the trigonometric functions at are the same except possibly for sign as their values at We illustrate this procedure in the next example.

38,38,5.3,Trigonometric Graphs,386,Graphs of Sine and Cosine Graphs of Transformations of Sine and Cosine Using Graphing Devices to Graph Trigonometric Functions The graph of function gives us better idea of its behavior. So in this section we graph the sine and cosine functions and certain transformations of these functions. The other trigonometric functions are graphed in the next section. Graphs of Sine and Cosine To help us graph the sine and cosine functions we first observe that these functions repeat their values in regular fashion. To see exactly how this happens recall that the circumfer- ence of the unit circle is 2p. It follows that the terminal point P1x y2 determined by the real number is the same as that determined by 2p. Since the sine and cosine functions are defined in terms of the coordinates of P1x y2 it follows that their values are unchanged by the addition of any integer multiple of 2p. In other words sin1t 2np2 sin for any integer cos1t 2np2 cos for any integer Thus the sine and cosine functions are periodic according to the following definition: function is periodic if there is positive number such that f1t p2 f1t2 for every t. The least such positive number (if it exists) is the period of f. If has period then the graph of on any interval of length is called one complete period of f. PERIODIC PROPERTIES OF SINE AND COSINE The functions sine and cosine have period 2p: sin1t 2p2 sin TABLE sin cos cos1t 2p2 cos So the sine and cosine functions repeat their values in any interval of length 2p. To sketch their graphs we first graph one period. To sketch the graphs on the interval 2p we could try to make table of values and use those points to draw the graph. Since no such table can be complete lets look more closely at the definitions of these functions. Recall that sin is the y-coordinate of the terminal point P1x on the unit circle de- termined by the real number t. How does the y-coordinate of this point vary as increases? Its easy to see that the y-coordinate of P1x y2 increases to then decreases to re- peatedly as the point P1x y2 travels around the unit circle. (See Figure 1.) In fact as in- creases from to p2 sin increases from to 1. As increases from p2 to the value of sin decreases from to 0. Table shows the variation of the sine and co- sine functions for between and 2p. Now we use this information to graph the functions sin and cos for between and 2p in Figures and 3. These are the graphs of one period. Using the fact that these functions are periodic with period 2p we get their complete graphs by continuing the same pattern to the left and to the right in every successive interval of length 2p. The graph of the sine function is symmetric with respect to the origin. This is as ex- pected since sine is an odd function. Since the cosine function is an even function its graph is symmetric with respect to the y-axis. Graphs of Transformations of Sine and Cosine We now consider graphs of functions that are transformations of the sine and cosine func- tions. Thus the graphing techniques of Section 2.5 are very useful here. The graphs we obtain are important for understanding applications to physical situations such as har- monic motion (see Section 5.6) but some of them are beautiful graphs that are interest- ing in their own right. Its traditional to use the letter to denote the variable in the domain of function. So from here on we use the letter and write sin cos tan and so on to denote these functions. SINE AND COSINE CURVES The sine and cosine curves sin kx and 1k 02 cos kx have amplitude and period 2pk An appropriate interval on which to graph one complete period is 30 2pk4. Horizontal stretching and shrinking of graphs is discussed in Section 2.5. To see how the value of affects the graph of sin kx lets graph the sine curve sin 2x. Since the period is 2p2 the graph completes one period in the interval (see Figure 8(a)). For the sine curve sin 12 the period is 2p 12 4p so the graph completes one period in the interval 4p (see Figure 8(b)). We see that the effect is to shrink the graph horizontally if or to stretch the graph horizontally if 1. SHIFTED SINE AND COSINE CURVES The sine and cosine curves sin k1x b2 and cos k1x b2 have amplitude period 2pk and phase shift b. 1k 02 An appropriate interval on which to graph one complete period is 3b 12pk2 Copyright 2010 Cengage Learning.

39,39,5.4,More Trigonometric Graphs,399,Graphs of Tangent Cotangent Secant and Cosecant Graphs of Transforma- tions of Tangent and Cotangent Graphs of Transformations of Cosecant and Secant In this section we graph the tangent cotangent secant and cosecant functions and trans- formations of these functions. Graphs of Tangent Cotangent Secant and Cosecant We begin by stating the periodic properties of these functions. Recall that sine and cosine have period 2p. Since cosecant and secant are the reciprocals of sine and cosine respec- tively they also have period 2p (see Exercise 55). Tangent and cotangent however have period (see Exercise 85 of Section 5.2). PERIODIC PROPERTIES The functions tangent and cotangent have period p: tan1x p2 tan cot1x p2 cot The functions cosecant and secant have period 2p: sec1x 2p2 sec csc1x 2p2 csc tan 1.4 1.5 1.55 1.57 1.5707 0.58 1.00 1.73 5.80 14.10 48.08 1255.77 10381.33 We first sketch the graph of tangent. Since it has period we need only sketch the graph on any interval of length and then repeat the pattern to the left and to the right. We sketch the graph on the interval 1p2 p22 Since tan1p22 and tan1p22 arent defined we need to be careful in sketching the graph at points near p2 and p2. As gets near p2 through values less than p2 the value of tan becomes large. To see this notice that as gets close to p2 cos approaches and sin approaches and so tan sin xcos is large. table of values of tan for close to p2 11.5707962 is shown in the margin. Thus by choosing close enough to p2 through values less than p2 we can make the value of tan larger than any given positive number. We express this by writing tan as This is read tan approaches infinity as approaches p2 from the left. In similar way by choosing close to p2 through values greater than p2 we can make tan smaller than any given negative number. We write this as Arrow notation is discussed in Section 3.7. Asymptotes are discussed in Section 3.7. tan as This is read tan approaches negative infinity as approaches p2 from the right. Thus the graph of tan approaches the vertical lines p2 and p2. So these lines are vertical asymptotes. With the information we have so far we sketch the graph of tan for p2 p2 in Figure 1. The complete graph of tangent (see Figure 5(a) on the next page) is now obtained using the fact that tangent is periodic with period p. Vertical asymptote Evaluating Functions on Calculator How does your calculator evaluate sin cos ln 1t and other such func- tions? One method is to approximate these functions by polynomials be- cause polynomials are easy to evaluate. For example sin cos where n.These remark- able formulas were found by the British mathematician Brook Taylor (1685 1731). For instance if we use the first three terms of Taylors series to find cos(0.4) we get cos 0.4 10.4 10.4 AT AT THE MODERN WORLD 1.4 0.14 Vertical asymptote FIGURE FIGURE One period of tan One period of cot The function cot is graphed on the interval 10 p2 by similar analysis (see Fig- ure 2). Since cot is undefined for np with an integer its complete graph (in Fig- ure 5(b) on the next page) has vertical asymptotes at these values. To graph the cosecant and secant functions we use the reciprocal identities csc sin and sec cos So to graph csc we take the reciprocals of the y-coordinates of the points of the graph of sin x. (See Figure 3.) Similarly to graph sec we take the reciprocals of the y-coordinates of the points of the graph of cos x. (See Figure 4.) 0.92106667 (Compare this with the value you get from your calculator.) The graph shows that the more terms of the series we use the more closely the polynomials approximate the function cos t. cos FIGURE FIGURE One period of csc One period of sec Lets consider more closely the graph of the function csc on the interval p. We need to examine the values of the function near and since at these values sin and csc is thus undefined. We see that csc as csc as Thus the lines and are vertical asymptotes. In the interval 2p the graph is sketched in the same way. The values of csc in that interval are the same as those in the interval except for sign (see Figure 3). The complete graph in Fig- ure 5(c) is now obtained from the fact that the function cosecant is periodic with period Graphs of Transformations of Tangent and Cotangent We now consider graphs of transformations of the tangent and cotangent functions. Since the tangent and cotangent functions have period the functions and tan kx 1k 02 cot kx complete one period as kx varies from to that is for kx p. Solving this in- equality we get pk. So they each have period pk. TANGENT AND COTANGENT CURVES The functions and tan kx 1k 02 cot kx have period pk. Thus one complete period of the graphs of these functions occurs on any interval of length pk. To sketch complete period of these graphs its convenient to select an in- terval between vertical asymptotes: To graph one period of tan kx an appropriate interval is 2k 2k To graph one period of cot kx an appropriate interval is EXAMPLE Graphing Tangent Curves Graphs of Transformations of Cosecant and Secant We have already observed that the cosecant and secant functions are the reciprocals of the sine and cosine functions. Thus the following result is the counterpart of the result for sine and cosine curves in Section 5.3.

40,40,5.5,Inverse Trigonometric Functions and Their Graphs,406,The Inverse Sine Function The Inverse Cosine Function The Inverse Tangent Function The Inverse Secant Cosecant and Cotangent Functions We study applications of inverse trigonometric functions to triangles in Sections 6.46.6. Recall from Section 2.7 that the inverse of function is function that reverses the rule of f. For function to have an inverse it must be one-to-one. Since the trigonometric func- tions are not one-to-one they do not have inverses. It is possible however to restrict the do- mains of the trigonometric functions in such way that the resulting functions are one-to-one. The Inverse Sine Function Lets first consider the sine function. There are many ways to restrict the domain of sine so that the new function is one-to-one. natural way to do this is to restrict the domain to the inter- val p2 p2 The reason for this choice is that sine is one-to-one on this interval and moreover attains each of the values in its range on this interval. From Figure we see that sine is one-to-one on this restricted domain (by the Horizontal Line Test) and so has an inverse. Graphs of the sine func- tion and the restricted sine function We can now define an inverse sine function on this restricted domain. The graph of sin is shown in Figure it is obtained by reflecting the graph of sin p2 p2 in the line ysinx Inverse Trigonometric Functions and Their Graphs 407 DEFINITION OF THE INVERSE SINE FUNCTION The inverse sine function is the function sin with domain and range p2 p2 defined by sin sin The inverse sine function is also called arcsine denoted by arcsin. Graph of sin Thus sin is the number in the interval p2 p2 whose sine is x. In other words sin1sin In fact from the general properties of inverse functions studied in Section 2.7 we have the following cancellation properties. sin1sin x2 sin 1sin x2 EXAMPLE for The Inverse Cosine Function If the domain of the cosine function is restricted to the interval the resulting func- tion is one-to-one and so has an inverse. We choose this interval because on it cosine at- tains each of its values exactly once (see Figure 3). Graphs of the cosine function and the restricted cosine function 0x DEFINITION OF THE INVERSE COSINE FUNCTION The inverse cosine function is the function cos with domain 31 14 and range defined by cos The inverse cosine function is also called arccosine denoted by arccos. Thus cos is the number in the interval whose cosine is x. The follow- ing cancellation properties follow from the inverse function properties. ycosx cos1cos x2 for cos 1cos x2 for cos Graph of cos The graph of cos is shown in Figure it is obtained by reflecting the graph of The Inverse Tangent Function We restrict the domain of the tangent function to the interval 1p2 p2 in order to ob- tain one-to-one function. DEFINITION OF THE INVERSE TANGENT FUNCTION The inverse tangent function is the function tan with domain and range 1p2 p2 defined by tan tan The inverse tangent function is also called arctangent denoted by arctan. Thus tan is the number in the interval 1p2 p2 whose tangent is x. The following cancellation properties follow from the inverse function properties. The Inverse Secant Cosecant and Cotangent Functions See Exercise 44 in Section 6.4 (page 469) for way of finding the values of these inverse trigonometric functions on calculator. To define the inverse functions of the secant cosecant and cotangent functions we re- strict the domain of each function to set on which it is one-to-one and on which it at- tains all its values. Although any interval satisfying these criteria is appropriate we choose to restrict the domains in way that simplifies the choice of sign in computations involving inverse trigonometric functions. The choices we make are also appropriate for calculus. This explains the seemingly strange restriction for the domains of the secant and cosecant functions. We end this section by displaying the graphs of the secant cosecant and cotangent functions with their restricted domains and the graphs of their inverse func- tions (Figures 68). ,Triangle|Calculus|Injective function|Injective function|Injective function|Injective function|Injective function|Injective function|Injective function|Injective function|Injective function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Domain of a function|Domain of a function|Domain of a function|Domain of a function|Domain of a function|Domain of a function|Domain of a function|Domain of a function|Domain of a function|Domain of a function|Domain of a function|Domain of a function|Domain of a function|Inverse trigonometric functions|Inverse trigonometric functions|Inverse trigonometric functions|Inverse trigonometric functions|Inverse trigonometric functions|Inverse trigonometric functions|Inverse trigonometric functions|Inverse trigonometric functions|Inverse trigonometric functions|Inverse trigonometric functions|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Interval (mathematics)|Interval (mathematics)|Interval (mathematics)|Interval (mathematics)|Interval (mathematics)|Interval (mathematics)|Interval (mathematics)|Interval (mathematics)|Interval (mathematics)|Set (mathematics)|Sign (mathematics)|Universal quantification|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Number|Number|Number|Secant line|Secant line|Secant line|Secant line|Secant line|Derivative|Differential equation|Range (mathematics)|Range (mathematics)|Range (mathematics)|Range (mathematics)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)
41,41,5.6,Modeling Harmonic Motion,412,Simple Harmonic Motion Damped Harmonic Motion Periodic behaviorbehavior that repeats over and over againis common in nature. Perhaps the most familiar example is the daily rising and setting of the sun which re- sults in the repetitive pattern of day night day night Another example is the daily variation of tide levels at the beach which results in the repetitive pattern of high tide low tide high tide low tide Certain animal populations increase and de- crease in predictable periodic pattern: large population exhausts the food supply which causes the population to dwindle this in turn results in more plentiful food supply which makes it possible for the population to increase and the pattern then re- peats over and over (see the Discovery Project PredatorPrey Models referenced on page 398). Other common examples of periodic behavior involve motion that is caused by vibra- tion or oscillation. mass suspended from spring that has been compressed and then al- lowed to vibrate vertically is simple example. This back and forth motion also occurs in such diverse phenomena as sound waves light waves alternating electrical current and pulsating stars to name few. In this section we consider the problem of modeling peri- odic behavior. Simple Harmonic Motion The trigonometric functions are ideally suited for modeling periodic behavior. glance at the graphs of the sine and cosine functions for instance tells us that these functions themselves exhibit periodic behavior. Figure shows the graph of sin t. If we think of Damped Harmonic Motion The spring in Figure on page 413 is assumed to oscillate in frictionless environment. In this hypothetical case the amplitude of the oscillation will not change. In the presence of friction however the motion of the spring eventually dies down that is the amplitude of the motion decreases with time. Motion of this type is called damped harmonic motion. DAMPED HARMONIC MOTION If the equation describing the displacement of an object at time is ke ct sin vt or 1c ke ct cos vt then the object is in damped harmonic motion. The constant is the damping constant is the initial amplitude and 2pv is the period.* Damped harmonic motion is simply harmonic motion for which the amplitude is gov- erned by the function a1t ke ct Figure 12 shows the difference between harmonic mo- tion and damped harmonic motion. ,Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Sine|Sine|Sine|Amplitude|Amplitude|Amplitude|Amplitude|Mathematics|Subtraction|Continuous function|Simple harmonic motion|Simple harmonic motion|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Angle|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Set (mathematics)|Equation|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Trigonometry|Displacement (vector)|Derivative|Periodic function|Periodic function|Periodic function|Periodic function|Periodic function|Periodic function
42,42,6,TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS: RIGHT TRIANGLE APPROACH,433,Suppose we want to find the distance from the earth to the sun. Using tape measure is obviously impractical so we need something other than simple measurements to tackle this problem. Angles are easier to measure than dis- tances. For example we can find the angle formed by the sun earth and moon by simply pointing to the sun with one arm and to the moon with the other and estimating the angle between them. The key idea is to find relationships be- tween angles and distances. So if we had way of determining distances from angles we would be able to find the distance to the sun without having to go there. The trigonometric functions provide us with just the tools we need. 6.6 The Law of Cosines FOCUS ON MODELING Surveying If is an angle in right triangle then the trigonometric ratio sin is de- fined as the length of the side opposite divided by the length of the hypo- tenuse. This ratio is the same in any similar right triangle including the huge triangle formed by the sun earth and moon (See Section 6.2 Exercise 61.) The trigonometric functions can be defined in two different but equivalent ways: as functions of real numbers (Chapter 5) or as functions of angles (Chapter 6). The two approaches are independent of each other so either Chapter or Chapter may be studied first. We study both approaches be- cause the different approaches are required for different applications. ,Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Sine|Focus (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Subtraction|Subtraction|Subtraction|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Division (mathematics)|Length|Length|Division by zero|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Existential quantification|Number|Determinant|Derivative|Derivative|Derivative|Right triangle|Right triangle|Real number|Spherical law of cosines|Distance|Distance|Distance|Distance|Homogeneous polynomial|Homogeneous polynomial
43,43,6.1,Angle Measure,434,Angle Measure Angles in Standard Position Length of Circular Arc Area of Circular Sector Circular Motion An angle AOB consists of two rays and with common vertex (see Figure 1). We often interpret an angle as rotation of the ray onto In this case is called the initial side and is called the terminal side of the angle. If the rotation is counter- clockwise the angle is considered positive and if the rotation is clockwise the angle is considered negative. terminal side initial side initial side terminal side Positive angle Negative angle FIGURE Angle Measure The measure of an angle is the amount of rotation about the vertex required to move onto Intuitively this is how much the angle opens. One unit of measurement for an- gles is the degree. An angle of measure degree is formed by rotating the initial side 360 of complete revolution. In calculus and other branches of mathematics more natural method of measuring angles is usedradian measure. The amount an angle opens is measured along the arc of circle of radius with its center at the vertex of the angle. DEFINITION OF RADIAN MEASURE Radian measure of If circle of radius is drawn with the vertex of an angle at its center then the measure of this angle in radians (abbreviated rad) is the length of the arc that subtends the angle (see Figure 2). FIGURE The circumference of the circle of radius is 2p and so complete revolution has mea- sure 2p rad straight angle has measure rad and right angle has measure p2 rad. An angle that is subtended by an arc of length along the unit circle has radian measure (see Figure 3). RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DEGREES AND RADIANS 180 1. To convert degrees to radians multiply by 180 rad 180 rad 2. To convert radians to degrees multiply by rad 180 180 Angles in Standard Position An angle is in standard position if it is drawn in the xy-plane with its vertex at the ori- gin and its initial side on the positive x-axis. Figure gives examples of angles in stan- dard position. Length of Circular Arc An angle whose radian measure is is subtended by an arc that is the fraction u12p2 of the circumference of circle. Thus in circle of radius the length of an arc that sub- tends the angle (see Figure 9) is ur circumference of circle 2p 12pr2 ur 2p LENGTH OF CIRCULAR ARC In circle of radius the length of an arc that subtends central angle of ra- dians is Solving for we get the important formula This formula allows us to define radian measure using circle of any radius r: The radian measure of an angle is sr where is the length of the circular arc that subtends in circle of radius (see Figure 10). Area of Circular Sector The area of circle of radius is pr sector of this circle with central angle has an area that is the fraction u12p2 of the area of the entire circle (see Figure 11). So the area of this sector is FIGURE 11 12 area of circle 2p 1pr 2p AREA OF CIRCULAR SECTOR In circle of radius the area of sector with central angle of radians is Circular Motion Suppose point moves along circle as shown in Figure 12. There are two ways to describe the motion of the point: linear speed and angular speed. Linear speed is the rate at which the distance traveled is changing so linear speed is the distance traveled di- vided by the time elapsed. Angular speed is the rate at which the central angle is chang- ing so angular speed is the number of radians this angle changes divided by the time elapsed. LINEAR SPEED AND ANGULAR SPEED Suppose point moves along circle of radius and the ray from the center of the circle to the point traverses radians in time t. Let ru be the distance the point travels in time t. Then the speed of the object is given by The symbol is the Greek letter omega.

44,44,6.2,Trigonometry of Right Triangles,443,Trigonometric Ratios Special Triangles Applications of Trigonometry of Right Triangles In this section we study certain ratios of the sides of right triangles called trigonometric ratios and give several applications. Trigonometric Ratios Consider right triangle with as one of its acute angles. The trigonometric ratios are defined as follows (see Figure 1). THE TRIGONOMETRIC RATIOS hypotenuse opposite sin opposite hypotenuse cos adjacent hypotenuse tan opposite adjacent csc hypotenuse opposite sec hypotenuse adjacent cot adjacent opposite adjacent FIGURE The symbols we use for these ratios are abbreviations for their full names: sine cosine tangent cosecant secant cotangent. Since any two right triangles with angle are similar these ratios are the same regardless of the size of the triangle the trigonometric ratios depend only on the angle (see Figure 2). Special Triangles Certain right triangles have ratios that can be calculated easily from the Pythagorean The- orem. Since they are used frequently we mention them here. The first triangle is obtained by drawing diagonal in square of side (see Figure 5). By the Pythagorean Theorem this diagonal has length 12 The resulting triangle has an- gles 45 45 and 90 (or p4 p4 and p2). To get the second triangle we start with an equilateral triangle ABC of side and draw the perpendicular bisector DB of the base as in Figure 6. By the Pythagorean Theorem the length of DB is 13 Since DB bisects an- gle ABC we obtain triangle with angles 30 60 and 90 (or p6 p3 and p2). We can now use the special triangles in Figures and to calculate the trigonometric ratios for angles with measures 30 45 and 60 (or p6 p4 and p3). These are listed in Table 1. 45* TABLE Values of the trigonometric ratios for special angles FIGURE 30* in radians sin cos tan csc sec cot 30 13 13 13 13 45 12 12 12 12 60 13 13 13 13 60* in degrees FIGURE For an explanation of numerical meth- ods see the margin note on page 400. Its useful to remember these special trigonometric ratios because they occur often. Of course they can be recalled easily if we remember the triangles from which they are obtained. To find the values of the trigonometric ratios for other angles we use calculator. Mathematical methods (called numerical methods) used in finding the trigonometric ra- tios are programmed directly into scientific calculators. For instance when the SIN key is pressed the calculator computes an approximation to the value of the sine of the given angle. Calculators give the values of sine cosine and tangent the other ratios can be eas- ily calculated from these by using the following reciprocal relations: csc sin sec cos cot tan You should check that these relations follow immediately from the definitions of the trigonometric ratios. We follow the convention that when we write sin we mean the sine of the angle whose radian measure is t. For instance sin means the sine of the angle whose radian measure is 1. When using calculator to find an approximate value for this number set your cal- culator to radian mode you will find that sin 0.841471 If you want to find the sine of the angle whose measure is set your calculator to degree mode you will find that sin 0.0174524 Applications of Trigonometry of Right Triangles triangle has six parts: three angles and three sides. To solve triangle means to deter- mine all of its parts from the information known about the triangle that is to determine the lengths of the three sides and the measures of the three angles. ,Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Mereology|Mereology|Solution of triangles|Mathematics|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Inverse trigonometric functions|Inverse trigonometric functions|Inverse trigonometric functions|Inverse trigonometric functions|Inverse trigonometric functions|Inverse trigonometric functions|Inverse trigonometric functions|Inverse trigonometric functions|Inverse trigonometric functions|Pythagorean theorem|Pythagorean theorem|Pythagorean theorem|Pythagorean theorem|Square (algebra)|Base (exponentiation)|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Graph (mathematics)|Multiplicative inverse|Perpendicular|Set (mathematics)|Set (mathematics)|Length|Length|Length|Universal quantification|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Number|Secant line|Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean|Determinant|Matrix (mathematics)|Right triangle|Right triangle|Right triangle|Right triangle|Right triangle|Right triangle|List of mathematical symbols
45,45,6.3,Trigonometric Functions of Angles,451,Trigonometric Functions of Angles Evaluating Trigonometric Functions at Any Angle Trigonometric Identities Areas of Triangles In the preceding section we defined the trigonometric ratios for acute angles. Here we ex- tend the trigonometric ratios to all angles by defining the trigonometric functions of an- gles. With these functions we can solve practical problems that involve angles that are not necessarily acute. Trigonometric Functions of Angles Let POQ be right triangle with acute angle as shown in Figure 1(a). Place in stan- dard position as shown in Figure 1(b). opposite hypotenuse adjacent (x y) (a) (b) FIGURE Then P1x is point on the terminal side of u. In triangle POQ the opposite side has length and the adjacent side has length x. Using the Pythagorean Theorem we see that the hypotenuse has length 2x So P(x y) sin cos tan The other trigonometric ratios can be found in the same way. These observations allow us to extend the trigonometric ratios to any angle. We define the trigonometric functions of angles as follows (see Figure 2). FIGURE DEFINITION OF THE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS Let be an angle in standard position and let P1x y2 be point on the terminal side. If 2x is the distance from the origin to the point P1x y2 then P(x y) P(x y) FIGURE sin csc 1y 02 cos sec 1x 02 tan cot 1x 02 02 Since division by is an undefined operation certain trigonometric functions are not defined for certain angles. For example tan 90 yx is undefined because 0. The angles for which the trigonometric functions may be undefined are the angles for which either the x- or y-coordinate of point on the terminal side of the angle is 0. These are quadrantal anglesangles that are coterminal with the coordinate axes. It is crucial fact that the values of the trigonometric functions do not depend on the choice of the point P1x y2 This is because if P1x is any other point on the terminal side as in Figure then triangles POQ and P(OQ( are similar. Evaluating Trigonometric Functions at Any Angle From the definition we see that the values of the trigonometric functions are all positive if the angle has its terminal side in Quadrant I. This is because and are positive in this quadrant. Of course is always positive since it is simply the distance from the ori- gin to the point P1x If the terminal side of is in Quadrant II however then is You may have already studied the trigonometric functions defined using the unit circle (Chapter 5). To see how they relate to the trigonometric func- tions of an angle lets start with the unit circle in the coordinate plane. sin cos By the definition of the trigonometric functions of the angle we have P(x y) P(x y) is the terminal point determined by t. Let 1x y2 be the terminal point determined by an arc of length on the unit circle. Then subtends an angle at the center of the circle. If we drop perpendicular from onto the point on the x-axis then triangle *OPQ is right triangle with legs of length and as shown in the figure. sin opp hyp cos adj hyp If is measured in radians then t. (See the figure below.) Comparing the two ways of defining the trigonometric functions we see that they are identical. In other words as functions they assign identical values to given real number. (The real number is the radian measure of in one case or the length of an arc in the other.) P(x y) P(x y) Now by the definition of the trigonometric functions of the real number we have Triangle OPQ is right triangle. The radian measure of angle is t. Why then do we study trigonometry in two dif- ferent ways? Because different applications require that we view the trigonometric functions differ- ently. (See Focus on Modeling pages 427 489 and 533 and Sections 6.2 6.5 and 6.6.) negative and is positive. Thus in Quadrant II the functions sin and csc are positive and all the other trigonometric functions have negative values. You can check the other en- tries in the following table.

We now turn our attention to finding the values of the trigonometric functions for an- gles that are not acute. EVALUATING TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS FOR ANY ANGLE FIGURE To find the values of the trigonometric functions for any angle we carry out the following steps. 1. Find the reference angle associated with the angle u. 2. Determine the sign of the trigonometric function of by noting the quadrant in which lies. 3. The value of the trigonometric function of is the same except possibly for sign as the value of the trigonometric function of Trigonometric Identities The trigonometric functions of angles are related to each other through several important equations called trigonometric identities. Weve already encountered the reciprocal identities. These identities continue to hold for any angle provided that both sides of the Areas of Triangles 13 180* We conclude this section with an application of the trigonometric functions that involves angles that are not necessarily acute. More extensive applications appear in the next two sections. The area of triangle is 12 base height If we know two sides and the in- cluded angle of triangle then we can find the height using the trigonometric functions and from this we can find the area. If is an acute angle then the height of the triangle in Figure 16(a) is given by sin u. Thus the area is 12 base height 12 ab sin If the angle is not acute then from Figure 16(b) we see that the height of the triangle is sin1180 u2 sin This is so because the reference angle of is the angle 180 u. Thus in this case also the area of the triangle is 12 base height 12 ab sin AREA OF TRIANGLE The area of triangle with sides of lengths and and with included angle is 12 ab sin

46,46,6.4,Inverse Trigonometric Functions and Right Triangles,462,The Inverse Sine Inverse Cosine and Inverse Tangent Functions Solving for Angles in Right Triangles Evaluating Expressions Involving Inverse Trigonometric Functions The graphs of the inverse trigonometric functions are studied in Section 5.5. Recall that for function to have an inverse it must be one-to-one. Since the trigonomet- ric functions are not one-to-one they do not have inverses. So we restrict the domain of each of the trigonometric functions to intervals on which they attain all their values and on which they are one-to-one. The resulting functions have the same range as the original functions but are one-to-one. The Inverse Sine Inverse Cosine and Inverse Tangent Functions Lets first consider the sine function. We restrict the domain of the sine function to angles with p2 p2 From Figure we see that on this domain the sine function at- tains each of the values in the interval exactly once and so is one-to-one. Simi- larly we restrict the domains of cosine and tangent as shown in Figure 1. On these restricted domains we can define an inverse for each of these functions. By the definition of inverse function we have sin cos sin cos tan tan We summarize the domains and ranges of the inverse trigonometric functions in the following box. THE INVERSE SINE INVERSE COSINE AND INVERSE TANGENT FUNCTIONS The sine cosine and tangent functions on the restricted domains p2 p2 and 1p2 p2 respectively are one-to one and so have inverses. The inverse functions have domain and range as follows. Function Domain Range p2 p2 sin cos tan 1p2 p2 The functions sin cos and tan are sometimes called arcsine arccosine and arctangent respectively. Since these are inverse functions they reverse the rule of the original function. For ex- ample since sin p6 12 it follows that sin 12 p6 The following example gives fur- ther illustrations. Solving for Angles in Right Triangles In Section 6.2 we solved triangles by using the trigonometric functions to find the unknown sides. We now use the inverse trigonometric functions to solve for angles in right triangle. Evaluating Expressions Involving Inverse Trigonometric Functions Expressions like cos1sin arise in calculus.

47,47,6.5,The Law of Sines,469,The Law of Sines The Ambiguous Case FIGURE (a) ASA or SAA In Section 6.2 we used the trigonometric ratios to solve right triangles. The trigonometric functions can also be used to solve oblique triangles that is triangles with no right an- gles. To do this we first study the Law of Sines here and then the Law of Cosines in the next section. To state these laws (or formulas) more easily we follow the convention of labeling the angles of triangle as and the lengths of the corresponding opposite sides as as in Figure 1. To solve triangle we need to know certain information about its sides and angles. To decide whether we have enough information its often helpful to make sketch. For in- stance if we are given two angles and the included side then its clear that one and only one triangle can be formed (see Figure 2(a)). Similarly if two sides and the included an- gle are known then unique triangle is determined (Figure 2(c)). But if we know all three angles and no sides we cannot uniquely determine the triangle because many triangles can have the same three angles. (All these triangles would be similar of course.) So we wont consider this last case. (b) SSA (c) SAS (d) SSS FIGURE In general triangle is determined by three of its six parts (angles and sides) as long as at least one of these three parts is side. So the possibilities illustrated in Figure are as follows. Case One side and two angles (ASA or SAA) Case Two sides and the angle opposite one of those sides (SSA) Case Two sides and the included angle (SAS) Case Three sides (SSS) Cases and are solved by using the Law of Sines Cases and require the Law of Cosines. The Law of Sines The Law of Sines says that in any triangle the lengths of the sides are proportional to the sines of the corresponding opposite angles. THE LAW OF SINES In triangle ABC we have sin sin sin The Ambiguous Case In Examples and unique triangle was determined by the information given. This is always true of Case (ASA or SAA). But in Case (SSA) there may be two triangles one triangle or no triangle with the given properties. For this reason Case is sometimes called the ambiguous case. To see why this is so we show in Figure the possibilities when angle and sides and are given. In part (a) no solution is possible since side is too short to complete the triangle. In part (b) the solution is right triangle. In part (c) two solutions are possible and in part (d) there is unique triangle with the given prop- erties. We illustrate the possibilities of Case in the following examples. ,Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Mereology|Mereology|Mereology|Mereology|Mereology|Mereology|Solution of triangles|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Pythagorean theorem|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Law of sines|Law of sines|Law of sines|Law of sines|Law of sines|Law of sines|Law of sines|Law of sines|Law of sines|Length|Length|Universal quantification|Universal quantification|Function (mathematics)|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Determinant|Determinant|Determinant|Determinant|Formula|Right triangle|Right triangle|Spherical law of cosines|Spherical law of cosines|Homogeneous polynomial
48,48,6.6,The Law of Cosines,476,"The Law of Cosines Navigation: Heading and Bearing The Area of Triangle The Law of Cosines The Law of Sines cannot be used directly to solve triangles if we know two sides and the angle between them or if we know all three sides (these are Cases and of the preced- ing section). In these two cases the Law of Cosines applies. THE LAW OF COSINES In any triangle ABC (see Figure 1) we have 2bc cos 2ac cos 2ab cos In words the Law of Cosines says that the square of any side of triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides minus twice the product of those two sides times the cosine of the included angle. If one of the angles of triangle say ""C is right angle then cos and the Law of Cosines reduces to the Pythagorean Theorem Thus the Pythagorean Theorem is special case of the Law of Cosines. Navigation: Heading and Bearing In navigation direction is often given as bearing that is as an acute angle measured from due north or due south.

49,49,7,ANALYTIC TRIGONOMETRY,493,In Chapters and we studied graphical and geometric properties of the trigonometric functions. In this chapter we study algebraic properties of these functions that is simplifying and factoring expressions and solving equations that involve trigonometric functions. We have used the trigonometric functions to model different real-world phenomena including periodic motion (such as the motion of an ocean wave). To obtain information from model we often need to solve equations. If the model involves trigonometric functions we need to solve trigonometric equations. Solving trigonometric equations often involves using trigonometric identities. Weve already encountered some basic trigonometric identities in the preceding chapters. We begin this chapter by finding many new identities. ,Subtraction|Algebra|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Identity (mathematics)|Identity (mathematics)|Identity (mathematics)|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Equation solving|Equation solving|Equation solving|Derivative|Periodic function|Expression (mathematics)|Geometry|Factorization
50,50,7.1,Trigonometric Identities,494,Simplifying Trigonometric Expressions Proving Trigonometric Identities We begin by listing some of the basic trigonometric identities. We studied most of these in Chapters and you are asked to prove the cofunction identities in Exercise 102. FUNDAMENTAL TRIGONOMETRIC IDENTITIES Reciprocal Identities csc sin sec tan sin cos cos cot cot tan cos sin Pythagorean Identities sin cos tan sec cot csc Even-Odd Identities sin1x2 sin cos1x2 cos tan1x2 tan Cofunction Identities sin cos cos sin tan cot cot tan sec csc csc sec Simplifying Trigonometric Expressions Identities enable us to write the same expression in different ways. It is often possible to rewrite complicated-looking expression as much simpler one. To simplify algebraic expressions we used factoring common denominators and the Special Product Formu- las. To simplify trigonometric expressions we use these same techniques together with the fundamental trigonometric identities. Proving Trigonometric Identities Many identities follow from the fundamental identities. In the examples that follow we learn how to prove that given trigonometric equation is an identity and in the process we will see how to discover new identities. First its easy to decide when given equation is not an identity. All we need to do is show that the equation does not hold for some value of the variable (or variables). Thus the equation sin cos is not an identity because when p4 we have sin 12 12 cos 12 To verify that trigonometric equation is an identity we transform one side of the equation into the other side by series of steps each of which is itself an identity. GUIDELINES FOR PROVING TRIGONOMETRIC IDENTITIES Pick one side of the equation and write it down. Your goal is to transform it into the other side. Its usually easier to start with the more complicated side. 2. Use known identities. Use algebra and the identities you know to change the side you started with. Bring fractional expressions to common denomi- nator factor and use the fundamental identities to simplify expressions. 3. Convert to sines and cosines. If you are stuck you may find it helpful to rewrite all functions in terms of sines and cosines. 1. Start with one side. Warning: To prove an identity we do not just perform the same operations on both sides of the equation. For example if we start with an equation that is not an identity such as (1) sin sin and square both sides we get the equation (2) sin sin which is clearly an identity. Does this mean that the original equation is an identity? Of course not. The problem here is that the operation of squaring is not reversible in the sense that we cannot arrive back at (1) from (2) by taking square roots (reversing the procedure). Only operations that are reversible will necessarily transform an identity into an identity. ,Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Sine|Mathematics|Subtraction|Algebra|Algebra|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Product topology|Inverse trigonometric functions|Inverse trigonometric functions|Inverse trigonometric functions|Inverse trigonometric functions|Inverse trigonometric functions|Inverse trigonometric functions|Inverse trigonometric functions|Inverse trigonometric functions|Inverse trigonometric functions|Inverse trigonometric functions|Inverse trigonometric functions|Inverse trigonometric functions|Inverse trigonometric functions|Inverse trigonometric functions|Identity (mathematics)|Identity (mathematics)|Identity (mathematics)|Identity (mathematics)|Identity (mathematics)|Identity (mathematics)|Identity (mathematics)|Identity (mathematics)|Identity (mathematics)|Identity (mathematics)|Identity (mathematics)|Identity (mathematics)|Identity (mathematics)|Identity (mathematics)|Identity (mathematics)|Identity (mathematics)|Identity (mathematics)|Identity (mathematics)|Identity (mathematics)|Identity (mathematics)|Identity (mathematics)|Identity (mathematics)|Identity (mathematics)|Identity (mathematics)|Identity (mathematics)|Identity (mathematics)|Identity (mathematics)|Identity (mathematics)|Identity (mathematics)|Square (algebra)|Square (algebra)|Square (algebra)|Mathematical proof|Mathematical proof|Mathematical proof|Mathematical proof|Mathematical proof|Mathematical proof|Series (mathematics)|Multiplicative inverse|Operation (mathematics)|Operation (mathematics)|Operation (mathematics)|Algebraic expression|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Universal quantification|Universal quantification|Origin (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Square root|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Trigonometry|Existential quantification|Pythagorean trigonometric identity|Nth root|Product (mathematics)|Multiplication|Arithmetic mean|Transformation (function)|Transformation (function)|Transformation (function)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Derivative|Expression (mathematics)|Expression (mathematics)|Expression (mathematics)|Expression (mathematics)|Expression (mathematics)|Expression (mathematics)|Expression (mathematics)|Expression (mathematics)|Factorization|Factorization

Expressions of the Form sin cos We can write expressions of the form sin cos in terms of single trigonometric function using the Addition Formula for Sine. For example consider the expression 13 sin cos If we set p3 then cos 12 and sin 132 and we can write 13 sin cos cos sin sin cos sin1x f2 sin We are able to do this because the coefficients 12 and 132 are precisely the cosine and sine of particular number in this case p3.

55,55,8,POLAR COORDINATES AND PARAMETRIC EQUATIONS,541,In Section 1.8 we learned how to graph points in rectangular coordinates. In this chapter we study different way of locating points in the plane called po- lar coordinates. Using rectangular coordinates is like describing location in city by saying that its at the corner of 2nd Street and 4th Avenue these direc- tions would help taxi driver find the location. But we may also describe this same location as the crow flies we can say that its 1.5 miles northeast of City Hall. So instead of specifying the location with respect to grid of streets and avenues we specify it by giving its distance and direction from fixed reference point. Thats what we do in the polar coordinate system. In polar coordinates the location of point is given by an ordered pair of numbers: the distance of the point from the origin (or pole) and the angle from the positive x-axis. Why do we study different coordinate systems? Its because certain curves are more naturally described in one coordinate system rather than another. For example in rectangular coordinates lines and parabolas have simple equations but equations of circles are rather complicated. Well see that in polar coordi- nates circles have very simple equations. ,Graph of a function|Plane (geometry)|Rectangle|Rectangle|Rectangle|Dependent and independent variables|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Subtraction|Subtraction|Circle|Circle|Angle|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Sign (mathematics)|Equation|Equation|Equation|Origin (mathematics)|Coordinate system|Coordinate system|Coordinate system|Coordinate system|Coordinate system|Coordinate system|Coordinate system|Coordinate system|Position (vector)|Number|Polar coordinate system|Polar coordinate system|Derivative|Derivative|Basis (linear algebra)|Basis (linear algebra)|Basis (linear algebra)|Basis (linear algebra)|Basis (linear algebra)|Basis (linear algebra)|Basis (linear algebra)|Basis (linear algebra)|Curve|Differential equation|Distance|Distance|Line (geometry)
56,56,8.1,Polar Coordinates,542,Definition of Polar Coordinates Relationship Between Polar and Rectangular Coordinates Polar Equations Definition of Polar Coordinates In this section we define polar coordinates and we learn how polar coordinates are related to rectangular coordinates. Polar axis FIGURE The polar coordinate system uses distances and directions to specify the location of point in the plane. To set up this system we choose fixed point in the plane called the pole (or origin) and draw from ray (half-line) called the polar axis as in Figure 1. Then each point can be assigned polar coordinates P1r u2 where is the distance from to |r| P(r r0 is the angle between the polar axis and the segment OP We use the convention that is positive if measured in counterclockwise direction from the polar axis or negative if measured in clockwise direction. If is negative then P1r u2 is defined to be the point that lies units from the pole in the direction opposite to that given by (see Figure 2). EXAMPLE FIGURE Plotting Points in Polar Coordinates Plot the points whose polar co Relationship Between Polar and Rectangular Coordinates FIGURE P(r P(x y) Situations often arise in which we need to consider polar and rectangular coordinates si- multaneously. The connection between the two systems is illustrated in Figure where the polar axis coincides with the positive x-axis. The formulas in the following box are obtained from the figure using the definitions of the trigonometric functions and the Pythagorean Theorem. (Although we have pictured the case where and is acute the formulas hold for any angle and for any value of r.) RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLAR AND RECTANGULAR COORDINATES 1.

57,57,8.2,Graphs of Polar Equations,547,"Graphing Polar Equations Symmetry Graphing Polar Equations with Graphing Devices The graph of polar equation 1u2 consists of all points that have at least one po- lar representation 1r u2 whose coordinates satisfy the equation. Many curves that arise in mathematics and its applications are more easily and naturally represented by polar equa- tions than by rectangular equations. Graphing Polar Equations rectangular grid is helpful for plotting points in rectangular coordinates (see Figure 1(a)). To plot points in polar coordinates it is convenient to use grid consisting of cir- cles centered at the pole and rays emanating from the pole as in Figure 1(b). We will use such grids to help us sketch polar graphs. In Examples and we see that circles centered at the origin and lines that pass through the origin have particularly simple equations in polar coordinates. Symmetry In graphing polar equation its often helpful to take advantage of symmetry. We list three tests for symmetry Figure shows why these tests work. TESTS FOR SYMMETRY 1. If polar equation is unchanged when we replace by ""u then the graph is symmetric about the polar axis (Figure 9(a)). 2. If the equation is unchanged when we replace by ""r then the graph is sym- metric about the pole (Figure 9(b)). 3. If the equation is unchanged when we replace by the graph is sym- metric about the vertical line p2 (the y-axis) (Figure 9(c)).

This en- ables us to find the nth roots of complex numbers. To describe the polar form of complex numbers we must first learn to work with complex numbers graphically. Imaginary axis a+b bi Real axis FIGURE Im 3i z2+3i 2i 2i To graph real numbers or sets of real numbers we have been using the number line which has just one dimension. Complex numbers however have two components: real part and an imaginary part. This suggests that we need two axes to graph complex numbers: one for the real part and one for the imaginary part. We call these the real axis and the imaginary axis respectively. The plane determined by these two axes is called the com- plex plane. To graph the complex number bi we plot the ordered pair of numbers 1a b2 in this plane as indicated in Figure 1. MODULUS OF COMPLEX NUMBER The modulus (or absolute value) of the complex number bi is FIGURE 2a Polar Form of Complex Numbers Re Let bi be complex number and in the complex plane lets draw the line seg- ment joining the origin to the point bi (see Figure 7). The length of this line seg- ment is If is an angle in standard position whose terminal side coincides with this line segment then by the definitions of sine and cosine (see Sec- tion 6.2) cos and sin so cos ir sin r(cos sin u). We have shown the following. POLAR FORM OF COMPLEX NUMBERS complex number bi has the polar form (or trigonometric form) 1cos sin where 2a and tan ba. The number is the modulus of and is an argument of z. The argument of is not unique but any two arguments of differ by multiple of 2p. When determining the argument we must consider the quadrant in which lies as we see in the next example. The Addition Formulas for Sine and Cosine that we discussed in Section 7.2 greatly simplify the multiplication and division of complex numbers in polar form. The follow- ing theorem shows how.

To divide two complex numbers divide the moduli and subtract the arguments. De Moivres Theorem Repeated use of the Multiplication Formula gives the following useful formula for raising complex number to power for any positive integer n.

59,59,8.4,Plane Curves and Parametric Equations,564,Plane Curves and Parametric Equations Eliminating the Parameter Finding Parametric Equations for Curve Using Graphing Devices to Graph Parametric Curves So far we have described curve by giving an equation (in rectangular or polar coordi- nates) that the coordinates of all the points on the curve must satisfy. But not all curves in the plane can be described in this way. In this section we study parametric equations which are general method for describing any curve. Plane Curves and Parametric Equations We can think of curve as the path of point moving in the plane the x- and y-coordinates of the point are then functions of time. This idea leads to the following definition. PLANE CURVES AND PARAMETRIC EQUATIONS If and are functions defined on an interval then the set of points 1f 1t2 g1t22 is plane curve. The equations f1t2 g1t where are parametric equations for the curve with parameter t. Eliminating the Parameter Often curve given by parametric equations can also be represented by single rectan- gular equation in and y. The process of finding this equation is called eliminating the pa- rameter. One way to do this is to solve for in one equation then substitute into the other. Finding Parametric Equations for Curve It is often possible to find parametric equations for curve by using some geometric prop- erties that define the curve as in the next two examples. Using Graphing Devices to Graph Parametric Curves 6.5 Most graphing calculators and computer graphing programs can be used to graph para- metric equations.

60,60,9,VECTORS IN TWO AND THREE DIMENSIONS,579,Many real-world quantities are described mathematically by just one number: their size or magnitude. For example quantities such as mass volume distance and temperature are described by their magnitude. But many other real-world quantities involve both magnitude and direction. Such quantities are described mathematically by vectors. For example if you push car with certain force the direction in which you push on the car is important you get different results if you push the car forward backward or perhaps sideways. So force is vector. The result of several forces acting on an object can be evaluated by using vectors. For example well see how we can combine the vector forces of wind and water on the sails and hull of sailboat to find the direction in which the boat will sail. Analyzing these vector forces helps sailors to sail against the wind by tacking.

61,61,9.1,Vectors in Two Dimensions,580,"Geometric Description of Vectors Vectors in the Coordinate Plane Using Vectors to Model Velocity and Force In applications of mathematics certain quantities are determined completely by their magnitudefor example length mass area temperature and energy. We speak of length of or mass of kg only one number is needed to describe each of these quan- tities. Such quantity is called scalar. On the other hand to describe the displacement of an object two numbers are re- quired: the magnitude and the direction of the displacement. To describe the velocity of moving object we must specify both the speed and the direction of travel. Quantities such as displacement velocity acceleration and force that involve magnitude as well as direc- tion are called directed quantities. One way to represent such quantities mathematically is through the use of vectors. uAB Geometric Description of Vectors FIGURE FIGURE ACAB+BC AB BC FIGURE vector in the plane is line segment with an assigned direction. We sketch vector as shown in Figure with an arrow to specify the direction. We denote this vector by AB Point is the initial point and is the terminal point of the vector AB The length of the line segment AB is called the magnitude or length of the vector and is denoted by AB We use boldface letters to denote vectors. Thus we write AB Two vectors are considered equal if they have equal magnitude and the same direction. Thus all the vectors in Figure are equal. This definition of equality makes sense if we think of vector as representing displacement. Two such displacements are the same if they have equal magnitudes and the same direction. So the vectors in Figure can be thought of as the same displacement applied to objects in different locations in the plane. If the displacement AB is followed by the displacement BC then the result- ing displacement is AC as shown in Figure 3. In other words the single displacement rep- resented by the vector We AC has the same effect as the other two displacements together. call the vector AC the sum of the vectors AB and BC and we write AC AB BC (The zero vector denoted by represents no displacement.) Thus to find the sum of any two vectors and we sketch vectors equal to and with the initial point of one at the terminal point of the other (see Figure 4(a)). If we draw and starting at the same point then is the vector that is the diagonal of the parallelogram formed by and shown in Figure 4(b). If is real number and is vector we define new vector av as follows: The vec- tor av has magnitude and has the same direction as if and the opposite direction if 0. If then av the zero vector. This process is called multipli- cation of vector by scalar. Multiplying vector by scalar has the effect of stretch- ing or shrinking the vector. Figure shows graphs of the vector av for different values of a. We write the vector 112 as v. Thus is the vector with the same length as but with the opposite direction.

By placing vector in coordinate plane we can describe it analytically (that is by using components). In Figure 7(a) to go from the initial point of the vector to the terminal point we move units to the right and units upward. We represent as an ordered pair of real numbers. Note the distinction between the vector b"" and the point 1a 8a b9 where is the horizontal component of and is the vertical component of v.

The velocity of moving object is modeled by vector whose direction is the direction of motion and whose magnitude is the speed. Figure 16 on the next page shows some vec- tors representing the velocity of wind flowing in the direction 30& and vector representing the velocity of an airplane flying through this wind at the point P. Its obvi- ous from our experience that wind affects both the speed and the direction of an airplane.

62,62,9.2,The Dot Product,589,The Dot Product of Vectors The Component of Along The Projection of Onto Work In this section we define an operation on vectors called the dot product. This concept is es- pecially useful in calculus and in applications of vectors to physics and engineering. The Dot Product of Vectors We begin by defining the dot product of two vectors. DEFINITION OF THE DOT PRODUCT If and are vectors then their dot product denoted by is defined by Thus to find the dot product of and we multiply corresponding components and add. The dot product is not vector it is real number or scalar. PROPERTIES OF THE DOT PRODUCT 1. 2. 1au2 a1u v2 1av2 3. 1u v2 4. Let and be vectors and sketch them with initial points at the origin. We define the angle between and to be the smaller of the angles formed by these representations of and (see Figure 1). Thus p. The next theorem relates the angle between two vectors to their dot product. THE DOT PRODUCT THEOREM If is the angle between two nonzero vectors and then cos ANGLE BETWEEN TWO VECTORS If is the angle between two nonzero vectors and then ORTHOGONAL VECTORS Two nonzero vectors and are perpendicular if and only if 0. The Component of Along The component of along (or the component of in the direction of v) is defined to be Note that the component of along is scalar not vector. cos where is the angle between and v. Figure gives geometric interpretation of this concept. Intuitively the component of along is the magnitude of the portion of that points in the direction of v. Notice that the component of along is negative if p. |u| cos FIGURE |u| cos In analyzing forces in physics and engineering its often helpful to express vector as sum of two vectors lying in perpendicular directions. For example suppose car is parked on an inclined driveway as in Figure 4. The weight of the car is vector that points directly downward. We can write where is parallel to the driveway and is perpendicular to the driveway. The vector is the force that tends to roll the car down the driveway and is the force experienced by the surface of the driveway. The magnitudes of these forces are the components of along and respectively. CALCULATING COMPONENTS The Projection of Onto Figure shows representations of the vectors and v. The projection of onto denoted by proj is the vector parallel to and whose length is the component of along as shown in Figure 6. To find an expression for proj we first find unit vector in the di- rection of and then multiply it by the component of along v: proj proj 1component of along 1unit vector in direction of v2 proj FIGURE We often need to resolve vector into the sum of two vectors one parallel to and one orthogonal to v. That is we want to write where is parallel to and is orthogonal to v. In this case proj and proj (see Exercise 43). Copyright 2010 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

CALCULATING PROJECTIONS The projection of onto is the vector proj given by proj If the vector is resolved into and where is parallel to and is or- thogonal to then proj EXAMPLE and proj Work One use of the dot product occurs in calculating work. In everyday use the term work means the total amount of effort required to perform task. In physics work has techni- cal meaning that conforms to this intuitive meaning. If constant force of magnitude moves an object through distance along straight line then the work done is Fd or work force distance If is measured in pounds and in feet then the unit of work is foot-pound (ft-lb). For example how much work is done in lifting 20-lb weight ft off the ground? Since force of 20 lb is required to lift this weight and since the weight moves through distance of ft the amount of work done is Fd 1202 162 120 ft-lb This formula applies only when the force is directed along the direction of motion. In the general case if the force moves an object from to as in Figure then only the component of the force in the direction of PQ affects the object. Thus the effective magnitude of the force on the object is |F| cos FIGURE So the work done is component of along cos force distance cos cos We have derived the following simple formula for calculating work.

63,63,9.3,Three-Dimensional Coordinate Geometry,597,"The Three-Dimensional Rectangular Coordinate System Distance Formula in Three Dimensions The Equation of Sphere To locate point in plane two numbers are necessary. We know that any point in the Cartesian plane can be represented as an ordered pair 1a b2 of real numbers where is the x-coordinate and is the y-coordinate. In three-dimensional space third dimension is added so any point in space is represented by an ordered triple 1a c2 of real numbers. The Three-Dimensional Rectangular Coordinate System To represent points in space we first choose fixed point (the origin) and three directed lines through that are perpendicular to each other called the coordinate axes and labeled the x-axis y-axis and z-axis. Usually we think of the x- and y-axes as being horizontal and the z-axis as being vertical and we draw the orientation of the axes as in Figure 1. The three coordinate axes determine the three coordinate planes illustrated in Figure 2(a). The xy-plane is the plane that contains the x- and y-axes the yz-plane is the plane that contains the y- and z-axes the xz-plane is the plane that contains the x- and z-axes. These three coordinate planes divide space into eight parts called octants.

Look at any bottom corner of room and call the corner the origin. The wall on your left is in the xz-plane the wall on your right is in the yz-plane and the floor is in the xy-plane. The x-axis runs along the intersection of the floor and the left wall the y-axis runs along the intersection of the floor and the right wall. The z-axis runs up from the floor toward the ceiling along the intersection of the two walls. Now any point in space can be located by unique ordered triple of real numbers 1a c2 as shown in Figure 3. The first number is the x-coordinate of the second number is the y-coordinate of and the third number is the z-coordinate of P. The set of all ordered triples 1x ""6 forms the three-dimensional rectangular co- ordinate system.

64,64,9.4,Vectors in Three Dimensions,603,Vectors in Space Combining Vectors in Space The Dot Product for Vectors in Space Recall that vectors are used to indicate quantity that has both magnitude and direction. In Section 9.1 we studied vectors in the coordinate plane where the direction is restricted to two dimensions. Vectors in space have direction that is in three-dimensional space. The properties that hold for vectors in the plane hold for vectors in space as well. Vectors in Space Recall from Section 9.1 that vector can be described geometrically by its initial point and terminal point. When we place vector in space with its initial point at the origin we can describe it algebraically as an ordered triple: (a a) 8a 8a where and are the components of (see Figure 1). Recall also that vector has many different representations depending on its initial point. The following definition gives the relationship between the algebraic and geometric representations of vector.

DEFINITION OF THE DOT PRODUCT FOR VECTORS IN THREE DIMENSIONS If 8a and 8b are vectors in three dimensions then their dot product is defined by Direction Angles of Vector The direction angles of nonzero vector are the angles and in the interval 30 p4 that the vector makes with the positive x- y- and z-axes (see Fig- ure 6). The cosines of these angles cos cos and cos are called the direction cosines of the vector a. By using the formula for the angle between two vectors we can find the direction cosines of a: DIRECTION ANGLES OF VECTOR If is nonzero vector in space the direction angles and satisfy PROPERT OF DIRECTION COSINES The direction angles and of nonzero vector in space satisfy the follow- ing equation: cos cos cos This property indicates that if we know two of the direction cosines of vector we can find the third up to its sign ,Plane (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Subtraction|Algebra|Algebra|Algebra|Algebra|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Dot product|Dot product|Dot product|Dot product|Dot product|Dot product|Dot product|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Graph (mathematics)|Interval (mathematics)|Operation (mathematics)|Operation (mathematics)|Norm (mathematics)|Norm (mathematics)|Norm (mathematics)|Sign (mathematics)|Sign (mathematics)|Sign (mathematics)|Equation|Universal quantification|Universal quantification|Origin (mathematics)|Coordinate system|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Position (vector)|Position (vector)|Algebraic operation|Algebraic operation|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Scalar (mathematics)|Derivative|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Formula|Formula|Formula|Basis (linear algebra)|Expression (mathematics)|Expression (mathematics)|Differential equation|Distance|Geometry|Geometry|Homogeneous polynomial|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector
65,65,9.5,The Cross Product,610,The Cross Product Properties of the Cross Product Area of Parallelogram Volume of Parallelepiped In this section we define an operation on vectors that allows us to find vector which is perpendicular to two given vectors. The Cross Product Given two vectors 8a and 8b we often need to find vector per- pendicular to both and b. If we write 8c then and so You can check that one of the solutions of this system of equations is the vector 8a This vector is called the cross product of and and is denoted by THE CROSS PRODUCT If 8a and 8b are three-dimensional vectors then the cross product of and is the vector 8a Determinants and their properties are studied in Section 10.7. The cross product of two vectors and unlike the dot product is vector (not scalar). For this reason it is also called the vector product. Note that is defined only when and are vectors in three dimensions. To help us remember the definition of the cross product we use the notation of deter- minants. determinant of order two is defined by determinant of order three is defined in terms of second-order determinants as Observe that each term on the right side of the above equation involves number in the first row of the determinant and is multiplied by the second-order determinant obtained from the left side by deleting the row and column in which appears. Notice also the mi- nus sign in the second term. For example 112 110 42 216 152 112 112 02 38 We can write the definition of the cross product using determinants as 1a 2i 1a 2j 1a 2k Although the first row of the above determinant consists of vectors we expand it as if it were an ordinary determinant of order 3. The symbolic formula given by the above de- terminant is probably the easiest way to remember and compute cross products. Properties of the Cross Product One of the most important properties of the cross product is the following theorem. CROSS PRODUCT THEOREM The vector is orthogonal (perpendicular) to both and b. direction perpendicular to the plane through and b. It turns out that the direction of is given by the right-hand rule: If the fingers of your right hand curl in the direc- tion of rotation (through an angle less than 180) from to then your thumb points in the direction of (as in Figure 2). You can check that the vector in Figure satisfies the right-hand rule. Now that we know the direction of the vector the remaining thing we need is the length LENGTH OF THE CROSS PRODUCT If is the angle between and (so then sin In particular two nonzero vectors and are parallel if and only if Area of Parallelogram b| Parallelogram determined by and We can use the cross product to find the area of parallelogram. If and are represented by directed line segments with the same initial point then they determine parallelogram with base altitude sin and area sin u2 (See Figure 3.) Thus we have the following way of interpreting the magnitude of cross product. AREA OF PARALLELOGRAM The length of the cross product is the area of the parallelogram determined by and b. Volume of Parallelepiped The product 1b is called the scalar triple product of the vectors and c. You can check that the scalar triple product can be written as the following determinant: 1b c2 The geometric significance of the scalar triple product can be seen by considering the par- allelepiped* determined by the vectors and (see Figure 4). The area of the base par- allelogram is If is the angle between and then the height of the parallelepiped is cos (We must use cos instead of cos in case p2 .) Therefore the volume of the parallelepiped is Ah cos 1b c2 The last equality follows from the Dot Product Theorem on page 590. Parallelepiped determined by and We have proved the following formula. VOLUME OF PARALLELEPIPED The volume of the parallelepiped determined by the vectors and is the magnitude of their scalar triple product: 1b c2 In particular if the volume of the parallelepiped is then the vectors and are coplanar. ,Plane (geometry)|Inequality (mathematics)|Sine|Sine|Sine|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Vector space|Simultaneous equations|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Rotation (mathematics)|Dot product|Dot product|Mathematical proof|Base (exponentiation)|Base (exponentiation)|Angle|Angle|Angle|Line segment|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Operation (mathematics)|Length|Length|Length|Norm (mathematics)|Norm (mathematics)|Sign (mathematics)|Equation|Equation|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Number|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Scalar (mathematics)|Scalar (mathematics)|Scalar (mathematics)|Scalar (mathematics)|Scalar (mathematics)|Determinant|Determinant|Determinant|Determinant|Determinant|Determinant|Determinant|Determinant|Determinant|Determinant|Determinant|Determinant|Determinant|Determinant|Determinant|Determinant|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Equality (mathematics)|Formula|Formula|Parallel (geometry)|Cross product|Cross product|Cross product|Cross product|Cross product|Cross product|Cross product|Cross product|Cross product|Cross product|Cross product|Cross product|Cross product|Cross product|Cross product|Cross product|Cross product|Cross product|Differential equation|Differential equation|Differential equation|Geometry|Scientific notation|Area|Area|Area|Area|Area|Area|Area|Line (geometry)|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|Euclidean vector|List of mathematical symbols|Equality
66,66,9.6,Equations of Lines and Planes,616,Equations of Lines Equations of Planes In this section we find equations for lines and planes in three-dimensional coordinate space. We use vectors to help us find such equations. Equations of Lines The position vector of point 1a is the vector 8a that is it is the vector from the origin to the point. line in three-dimensional space is determined when we know point 1x on and the direction of L. In three dimensions the direction of line is described by vec- tor parallel to L. If we let be the position vector of (that is the vector OP then for all real numbers the terminal points of the position vectors trace out line for This is the vector equation of line. Lets write the vector in component form 8a c9 and let 8x and 8x z9 Then the vector equation of the line becomes 8x z9 8x 8a c9 8x ta tb tc9 Since two vectors are equal if and only if their corresponding components are equal we have the following result. FIGURE PARAMETRIC EQUATIONS FOR LINE line passing through the point P1x and parallel to the vector 8a c9 is described by the parametric equations at bt ct where is any real number. In Example we used the point 11 62 to get the parametric equations of the line. We could instead use the point 12 72 The resulting parametric equations would look different but would still describe the same line (see Exercise 37). Equations of Planes Although line in space is determined by point and direction the direction of plane cannot be described by vector in the plane. In fact different vectors in plane can have different directions. But vector perpendicular to plane does completely specify the di- rection of the plane. Thus plane in space is determined by point 1x in the plane and vector that is orthogonal to the plane. This orthogonal vector is called normal vector. To determine whether point P1x is in the plane we check whether the vector with initial point and terminal point is orthogonal to the normal vector. Let and be the position vectors of and respectively. Then the vector is represented by (see Figure 4). So the plane is described by the tips of the vectors satisfying 1r This is the vector equation of the plane. FIGURE r-r Lets write the normal vector in component form 8a c9 and let 8x and 8x z9 Then the vector equation of the plane becomes 8a c9 8x Performing the dot product we arrive at the following equation of the plane in the vari- ables and z.

67,67,10,SYSTEMS OF EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES,629,Throughout the preceding chapters we modeled real-world situations by equations. But many real-world situations involve too many variables to be modeled by single equation. For example weather depends on the relationship among many variables including temperature wind speed air pressure and humidity. So to model (and forecast) the weather scientists use many equations each having many variables. Such collections of equations called systems of equations work together to describe the weather. Systems of equations with hundreds of variables are used by airlines to establish consistent flight schedules and by telecommunications companies to find efficient routings for telephone calls. In this chapter we learn how to solve systems of equations that consist of several equations in several variables. ,Simultaneous equations|Simultaneous equations|Simultaneous equations|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Work (physics)

Since the solution 13 12 satisfies each equation the point 13 12 lies on each line. So it is the point of inter- section of the two lines. x+4y7 (3 1) 2x-y5 FIGURE Substitution Method In the substitution method we start with one equation in the system and solve for one variable in terms of the other variable. The following box describes the procedure. SUBSTITUTION METHOD 1. Solve for One Variable. Choose one equation and solve for one variable in terms of the other variable. 2. Substitute. Substitute the expression you found in Step into the other equation to get an equation in one variable then solve for that variable. 3. Back-Substitute. Substitute the value you found in Step back into the expression found in Step to solve for the remaining variable. Elimination Method To solve system using the elimination method we try to combine the equations using sums or differences so as to eliminate one of the variables. ELIMINATION METHOD 1. Adjust the Coefficients. Multiply one or more of the equations by appropri- ate numbers so that the coefficient of one variable in one equation is the nega- tive of its coefficient in the other equation. 2. Add the Equations. Add the two equations to eliminate one variable then solve for the remaining variable. 3. Back-Substitute. Substitute the value that you found in Step back into one of the original equations and solve for the remaining variable. Graphical Method In the graphical method we use graphing device to solve the system of equations. GRAPHICAL METHOD 1. Graph Each Equation. Express each equation in form suitable for the graphing calculator by solving for as function of x. Graph the equations on the same screen. 2. Find the Intersection Points. the points of intersection. The Number of Solutions of Linear System in Two Variables The graph of linear system in two variables is pair of lines so to solve the system graphically we must find the intersection point(s) of the lines. Two lines may intersect in single point they may be parallel or they may coincide as shown in Figure 5. So there are three possible outcomes in solving such system. NUMBER OF SOLUTIONS OF LINEAR SYSTEM IN TWO VARIABLES For system of linear equations in two variables exactly one of the following is true. (See Figure 5.) 1. The system has exactly one solution. 2. The system has no solution. 3. The system has infinitely many solutions. system that has no solution is said to be inconsistent system with infinitely many solutions is called dependent Modeling with Linear Systems Frequently when we use equations to solve problems in the sciences or in other areas we obtain systems like the ones weve been considering. When modeling with systems of equations we use the following guidelines which are similar to those in Section 1.6. GUIDELINES FOR MODELING WITH SYSTEMS OF EQUATIONS 1. Identify the Variables. Identify the quantities that the problem asks you to find. These are usually determined by careful reading of the question posed at the end of the problem.

69,69,10.2,Systems of Linear Equations in Several Variables,640,Solving Linear System The Number of Solutions of Linear System Modeling Using Linear Systems linear equation in variables is an equation that can be put in the form where and are real numbers and are the variables. If we have only three or four variables we generally use and instead of and Such equations are called linear because if we have just two variables the equation is which is the equation of line. Here are some examples of equations in three variables that illustrate the difference between linear and nonlinear equations. Linear equations Nonlinear equations 6x 3x 15x 10 3y 1z 12 6x Not linear because it contains the square and the square root of variable Not linear because it contains product of variables In this section we study systems of linear equations in three or more variables. Solving Linear System The following are two examples of systems of linear equations in three variables. The sec- ond system is in triangular form that is the variable doesnt appear in the second equation and the variables and do not appear in the third equation. system of linear equations system in triangular form 2y 3y 3z 2x 3y 10 2y 2z Its easy to solve system that is in triangular form by using back-substitution. So our goal in this section is to start with system of linear equations and change it to system in triangular form that has the same solutions as the original system. We begin by show- ing how to use back-substitution to solve system that is already in triangular form. OPERATIONS THAT YIELD AN EQUIVALENT SYSTEM 1. Add nonzero multiple of one equation to another. 2. Multiply an equation by nonzero constant. 3. Interchange the positions of two equations. To solve linear system we use these operations to change the system to an equiva- lent triangular system. Then we use back-substitution as in Example 1. This process is called Gaussian elimination The Number of Solutions of Linear System The graph of linear equation in three variables is plane in three dimensional space (see Section 9.6). system of three equations in three variables represents three planes in space. The solutions of the system are the points where all three planes intersect. Three planes may intersect in point line not at all or all three planes may coincide. Figure illustrates some of these possibilities. Checking these possibilities we see that there are three possible outcomes when solving such system. NUMBER OF SOLUTIONS OF LINEAR SYSTEM For system of linear equations exactly one of the following is true. 1. The system has exactly one solution. 2. The system has no solution. 3. The system has infinitely many solutions. system with no solutions is said to be inconsistent and system with infinitely many solutions is said to be dependent As we see in the next example linear system has no solution if we end up with false equation after applying Gaussian elimination to the system.

In the next example we consider an application of linear systems to finance. ,Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Triangle|Graph of a function|Plane (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Mathematics|Mathematics|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Subtraction|Simultaneous equations|Simultaneous equations|Product topology|Inverse trigonometric functions|Square (algebra)|Square (algebra)|Graph (mathematics)|System of linear equations|System of linear equations|System of linear equations|System of linear equations|System of linear equations|Operation (mathematics)|Operation (mathematics)|Sign (mathematics)|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Universal quantification|Universal quantification|Universal quantification|Origin (mathematics)|Square root|Nth root|Product (mathematics)|Position (vector)|Number|Number|Number|Number|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Addition|Linear equation|Linear equation|Linear equation|Linear equation|Linear equation|Linear equation|Linear equation|Linear equation|Infinity|Infinity|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Derivative|Real number|Triangular matrix|Triangular matrix|Triangular matrix|Triangular matrix|Triangular matrix|Triangular matrix|Triangular matrix|Triangular matrix|Integer|Integer|Integer|Homogeneous polynomial|Homogeneous polynomial|Homogeneous polynomial|Homogeneous polynomial|Homogeneous polynomial|Homogeneous polynomial|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)
70,70,10.3,Matrices and Systems of Linear Equations,649,"Matrices The Augmented Matrix of Linear System Elementary Row Operations Gaussian Elimination Gauss-Jordan Elimination Inconsistent and Dependent Systems Modeling with Linear Systems matrix is simply rectangular array of numbers. Matrices* are used to organize informa- tion into categories that correspond to the rows and columns of the matrix. For example scientist might organize information on population of endangered whales as follows: Immature Juvenile 12 15 52 42 Male Female Adult 18 11 This is compact way of saying that there are 12 immature males 15 immature females 18 adult males and so on. In this section we represent linear system by matrix called the augmented matrix of the system: Linear system 2x 4y Augmented matrix Equation Equation The augmented matrix contains the same information as the system but in simpler form. The operations we learned for solving systems of equations can now be performed on the augmented matrix. Matrices We begin by defining the various elements that make up matrix. DEFINITION OF MATRIX An matrix is rectangular array of numbers with rows and columns 12 13 22 23 32 33 m2 m3 columns 1n 2n 3n rows mn 11 21 31 m1 We say that the matrix has dimension n. The numbers ij are the entries of the matrix. The subscript on the entry ij indicates that it is in the ith row and the jth column. The Augmented Matrix of Linear System We can write system of linear equations as matrix called the augmented matrix of the system by writing only the coefficients and constants that appear in the equations. Here is an example. Linear system Augmented matrix 3x 2y 3y 4z 11 11 Notice that missing variable in an equation corresponds to entry in the augmented matrix. Elementary Row Operations The operations that we used in Section 10.2 to solve linear systems correspond to opera- tions on the rows of the augmented matrix of the system. For example adding multiple of one equation to another corresponds to adding multiple of one row to another. ELEMENTARY ROW OPERATIONS 1. Add multiple of one row to another. 2. Multiply row by nonzero constant. 3. Interchange two rows. Note that performing any of these operations on the augmented matrix of system does not change its solution. We use the following notation to describe the elementary row operations: Symbol Description kR Change the ith row by adding times row to it and then put the result back in row i. kR Multiply the ith row by k. Interchange the ith and jth rows. In the next example we compare the two ways of writing systems of linear equations. Note that performing any of these operations on the augmented matrix of system does not change its solution. We use the following notation to describe the elementary row operations: Symbol Description kR Change the ith row by adding times row to it and then put the result back in row i. kR Multiply the ith row by k. Interchange the ith and jth rows. In the next example we compare the two ways of writing systems of linear equations. Gaussian Elimination In general to solve system of linear equations using its augmented matrix we use ele- mentary row operations to arrive at matrix in certain form. This form is described in the following box. ROW-ECHELON FORM AND REDUCED ROW-ECHELON FORM OF MATRIX matrix is in row-echelon form if it satisfies the following conditions. 1. The first nonzero number in each row (reading from left to right) is 1. This is called the leading entry. 2. The leading entry in each row is to the right of the leading entry in the row immediately above it. 3. All rows consisting entirely of zeros are at the bottom of the matrix. matrix is in reduced row-echelon form if it is in row-echelon form and also satisfies the following condition. 4. Every number above and below each leading entry is 0. In the following matrices the first one is not in row-echelon form. The second one is in row-echelon form and the third one is in reduced row-echelon form. The entries in red are the leading entries. Not in row-echelon form 12 ""5 0.4 Row-echelon form ""6 10 Reduced row-echelon form ""3 Leading 1s shift to the right in successive rows Leading 1s do not shift to the right in successive rows ""3 Leading 1s have 0s above and below them Here is systematic way to put matrix in row-echelon form using elementary row operations: Start by obtaining in the top left corner. Then obtain zeros below that by adding appropriate multiples of the first row to the rows below it. Next obtain leading in the next row and then obtain zeros below that 1. At each stage make sure that every leading entry is to the right of the leading entry in the row above itrearrange the rows if necessary. Continue this process until you arrive at matrix in row-echelon form. This is how the process might work for matrix: Once an augmented matrix is in row-echelon form we can solve the corresponding lin- ear system using back-substitution. This technique is called Gaussian elimination in honor of its inventor the German mathematician C. F. Gauss (see page 272). SOLVING SYSTEM USING GAUSSIAN ELIMINATION 1. Augmented Matrix. Write the augmented matrix of the system. 2. Row-Echelon Form. Use elementary row operations to change the aug- mented matrix to row-echelon form. 3. Back-Substitution. Write the new system of equations that corresponds to the row-echelon form of the augmented matrix and solve by back-substitution. Gauss-Jordan Elimination If we put the augmented matrix of linear system in reduced row-echelon form then we dont need to back-substitute to solve the system. To put matrix in reduced row-echelon form we use the following steps. Use the elementary row operations to put the matrix in row-echelon form. Obtain zeros above each leading entry by adding multiples of the row containing that entry to the rows above it. Begin with the last leading entry and work up. Here is how the process works for matrix: Using the reduced row-echelon form to solve system is called Gauss-Jordan elimina- tion The process is illustrated in the next example. Inconsistent and Dependent Systems The systems of linear equations that we considered in Examples 14 had exactly one solution. But as we know from Section 10.2 linear system may have one solution no solution or infinitely many solutions. Fortunately the row-echelon form of sys- tem allows us to determine which of these cases applies as described in the following box. First we need some terminology. leading variable in linear system is one that corresponds to leading entry in the row-echelon form of the augmented matrix of the system. THE SOLUTIONS OF LINEAR SYSTEM IN ROW-ECHELON FORM Suppose the augmented matrix of system of linear equations has been trans- formed by Gaussian elimination into row-echelon form. Then exactly one of the following is true. 1. No solution. If the row-echelon form contains row that represents the equa- tion where is not zero then the system has no solution. system with no solution is called inconsistent. 2. One solution. If each variable in the row-echelon form is leading variable then the system has exactly one solution which we find using back-substitution or Gauss-Jordan elimination. 3. Infinitely many solutions. If the variables in the row-echelon form are not all leading variables and if the system is not inconsistent then it has infinitely many solutions. In this case the system is called dependent. We solve the sys- tem by putting the matrix in reduced row-echelon form and then expressing the leading variables in terms of the nonleading variables. The nonleading variables may take on any real numbers as their values. Modeling with Linear Systems Linear equations often containing hundreds or even thousands of variables occur fre- quently in the applications of algebra to the sciences and to other fields. For now lets consider an example that involves only three variables.

71,71,10.4,The Algebra of Matrices,661,Equality of Matrices Addition Subtraction and Scalar Multiplication of Matrices Multiplication of Matrices Properties of Matrix Multiplication Applications of Matrix Multiplication Computer Graphics Thus far we have used matrices simply for notational convenience when solving linear systems. Matrices have many other uses in mathematics and the sciences and for most of these applications knowledge of matrix algebra is essential. Like numbers matrices can be added subtracted multiplied and divided. In this section we learn how to perform these algebraic operations on matrices. Equality of Matrices Two matrices are equal if they have the same entries in the same positions. EQUALIT OF MATRICES The matrices ij and ij are equal if and only if they have the same dimension and corresponding entries are equal that is ij ij for and n. Addition Subtraction and Scalar Multiplication of Matrices Two matrices can be added or subtracted if they have the same dimension. (Otherwise their sum or difference is undefined.) We add or subtract the matrices by adding or sub- tracting corresponding entries. To multiply matrix by number we multiply every ele- ment of the matrix by that number. This is called the scalar product. SUM DIFFERENCE AND SCALAR PRODUCT OF MATRICES Let ij and ij be matrices of the same dimension and let be any real number. 1. The sum is the matrix obtained by adding corresponding entries of and B. 3a ij ij 2. The difference is the matrix obtained by subtracting corre- sponding entries of and B. 3a ij ij 3. The scalar product cA is the matrix obtained by multiplying each entry of by c. cA 3ca ij PROPERTIES OF ADDITION AND SCALAR MULTIPLICATION OF MATRICES Let and be matrices and let and be scalars. Commutative Property of Matrix Addition 1A B2 1B C2 Associative Property of Matrix Addition c1dA2 cdA Associative Property of Scalar Multiplication 1c d2A cA dA c1A B2 cA cB Distributive Properties of Scalar Multiplication Multiplication of Matrices Multiplying two matrices is more difficult to describe than other matrix operations. In later examples we will see why multiplying matrices involves rather complex proce- dure which we now describe. First the product AB 1or B2 of two matrices and is defined only when the num- ber of columns in is equal to the number of rows in B. This means that if we write their dimensions side by side the two inner numbers must match: Matrices Dimensions Columns in If we think of the row of and the col- umn of as vectors then their inner product is the same as their dot product (see Sections 9.2 and 9.4). Rows in If the dimensions of and match in this fashion then the product AB is matrix of di- mension k. Before describing the procedure for obtaining the elements of AB we de- fine the inner product of row of and column of B. If is row of and if is column of then their inner product is the number For example taking the inner product of and gives 112 132 12 We now define the product AB of two matrices. MATRIX MULTIPLICATION If ij is an matrix and ij an matrix then their product is the matrix ij where ij is the inner product of the ith row of and the jth column of B. We write the product as AB This definition of matrix product says that each entry in the matrix AB is obtained from row of and column of as follows: The entry ij in the ith row and jth column of the matrix AB is obtained by multiplying the entries in the ith row of with the corresponding entries in the jth column of and adding the results. Properties of Matrix Multiplication FIGURE Although matrix multiplication is not commutative it does obey the Associative and Distributive Properties. PROPERTIES OF MATRIX MULTIPLICATION Let and be matrices for which the following products are defined. Then A1BC 1AB 2C Associative Property A1B C2 AB AC Distributive Property 1B C2A BA CA The next example shows that even when both AB and BA are defined they arent necessarily equal. This result proves that matrix multiplication is not commutative. Applications of Matrix Multiplication We now consider some applied examples that give some indication of why mathemati- cians chose to define the matrix product in such an apparently bizarre fashion. Exam- ple shows how our definition of matrix product allows us to express system of linear equations as single matrix equation. Computer Graphics One important use of matrices is in the digital representation of images. digital camera or scanner converts an image into matrix by dividing the image into rectangular ar- ray of elements called pixels. Each pixel is assigned value that represents the color brightness or some other feature of that location. For example in 256-level gray-scale image each pixel is assigned value between and 255 where represents white 255 represents black and the numbers in between represent increasing gradations of gray. The gradations of much simpler 8-level gray scale are shown in Figure 2. We use this eight- level gray scale to illustrate the process. To digitize the black and white image in Figure 3(a) we place grid over the picture as shown in Figure 3(b). Each cell in the grid is compared to the gray scale and then assigned value between and depending on which gray square in the scale most closely matches the darkness of the cell. (If the cell is not uniformly gray an average value is assigned.) The values are stored in the matrix shown in Figure 3(c). The digital image corresponding to this matrix is shown in Figure 3(d). Obviously the grid that we have used is far too coarse to provide good image resolution. In practice currently available high-resolution digital cameras use matrices with dimension as large as 2048 2048. Once the image is stored as matrix it can be manipulated by using matrix operations. For example to darken the image we add constant to each entry in the matrix to lighten the image we subtract constant. To increase the contrast we darken the darker areas and lighten the lighter areas so we could add to each entry that is or and subtract from each entry that is or 3. (Note that we cannot darken an entry of or lighten 0.) Applying this process to the matrix in Figure 3(c) produces the new matrix in Figure 4(a). This generates the high-contrast image shown in Figure 4(b). (a) Matrix modified to increase contrast (b) High contrast image FIGURE Other ways of representing and manipulating images using matrices are discussed in the Discovery Projects Computer Graphics and II at the book companion website: www.stewartmath.com. ,Rectangle|Mathematics|Subtraction|Subtraction|Subtraction|Subtraction|Subtraction|Subtraction|Subtraction|Subtraction|Subtraction|Subtraction|Subtraction|Commutative property|Commutative property|Commutative property|Algebra|Algebra|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Vector space|Associative property|Associative property|Associative property|Associative property|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Pythagorean theorem|Matrix ring|Closed set|Square (algebra)|Dot product|Dot product|Dot product|Dot product|Mathematical proof|Sum|Sum|Sum|Summation|Summation|Summation|Division (mathematics)|Division (mathematics)|System of linear equations|Operation (mathematics)|Operation (mathematics)|Operation (mathematics)|Sign (mathematics)|Equation|Equation|Image (mathematics)|Image (mathematics)|Image (mathematics)|Image (mathematics)|Image (mathematics)|Image (mathematics)|Image (mathematics)|Image (mathematics)|Image (mathematics)|Image (mathematics)|Image (mathematics)|Image (mathematics)|Image (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Position (vector)|Algebraic operation|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Addition|Addition|Addition|Addition|Addition|Addition|Addition|Addition|Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean|Scalar (mathematics)|Scalar (mathematics)|Scalar (mathematics)|Scalar (mathematics)|Scalar (mathematics)|Scalar (mathematics)|Scalar (mathematics)|Scalar (mathematics)|Scalar (mathematics)|Absolute value|Absolute value|Absolute value|Absolute value|Absolute value|Absolute value|Absolute value|Absolute value|Absolute value|Absolute value|Absolute value|Linear equation|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Derivative|Derivative|Derivative|Vector (mathematics and physics)|Equality (mathematics)|Equality (mathematics)|Equality (mathematics)|Equality (mathematics)|Equality (mathematics)|Equality (mathematics)|Equality (mathematics)|Real number|Scalar multiplication|Scalar multiplication|Scalar multiplication|Scalar multiplication|Scalar multiplication|Expression (mathematics)|Empty sum|Empty sum|Empty sum|Scientific notation|Matrix multiplication|Matrix multiplication|Matrix multiplication|Matrix multiplication|Matrix multiplication|Matrix multiplication|Matrix multiplication|Matrix multiplication|Matrix multiplication|Matrix multiplication|Matrix multiplication|Matrix multiplication|Area|Area|Line (geometry)|Distributive property|Distributive property|Distributive property|Euclidean vector|Equality|Equality|Equality|Equality|Equality|Equality|Equality
72,72,10.5,Inverses of Matrices and Matrix Equations,672,"The Inverse of Matrix Finding the Inverse of Matrix Finding the Inverse of an Matrix Matrix Equations Modeling with Matrix Equations In the preceding section we saw that when the dimensions are appropriate matrices can be added subtracted and multiplied. In this section we investigate division of matrices. With this operation we can solve equations that involve matrices. The Inverse of Matrix First we define identity matrices which play the same role for matrix multiplication as the number does for ordinary multiplication of numbers that is for all num- bers a. square matrix is one that has the same number of rows as columns. The main di- agonal of square matrix consists of the entries whose row and column numbers are the same. These entries stretch diagonally down the matrix from top left to bottom right. IDENTIT MATRIX The identity matrix is the matrix for which each main diagonal entry is and for which all other entries are 0. Thus the and identity matrices are Identity matrices behave like the number in the sense that and whenever these products are defined. INVERSE OF MATRIX Let be square matrix. If there exists an matrix with the property that AA then we say that is the inverse of A. Finding the Inverse of Matrix The following rule provides simple way for finding the inverse of matrix when it exists. For larger matrices there is more general procedure for finding inverses which we consider later in this section. INVERSE OF MATRIX If then ad bc If ad bc then has no inverse. Finding the Inverse of an Matrix For and larger square matrices the following technique provides the most efficient way to calculate their inverses. If is an matrix we first construct the 2n matrix that has the entries of on the left and of the identity matrix on the right: 11 21 n1 12 22 1n 2n n2 nn We then use the elementary row operations on this new large matrix to change the left side into the identity matrix. (This means that we are changing the large matrix to reduced row-echelon form.) The right side is transformed automatically into (We omit the proof of this fact.) Matrix Equations We saw in Example in Section 10.4 that system of linear equations can be written as single matrix equation. For example the system FIGURE 2y 4z 2x 3y 6z 3x 6y 15z is equivalent to the matrix equation 15 If we let 15 then this matrix equation can be written as AX The matrix is called the coefficient matrix. We solve this matrix equation by multiplying each side by the inverse of (provided that this inverse exists): Solving the matrix equation AX is very similar to solving the simple real-number equation 3x 12 which we do by multiplying each side by the reciprocal (or inverse) of 3. 13x2 1122 AX 1AX2 Multiply on left by ""1 1A A2X Associative Property Property of inverses Property of identity matrix We have proved that the matrix equation AX can be solved by the following method. SOLVING MATRIX EQUATION If is square matrix that has an inverse and if is variable matrix and known matrix both with rows then the solution of the matrix equation AX is given by Modeling with Matrix Equations Suppose we need to solve several systems of equations with the same coefficient matrix. Then converting the systems to matrix equations provides an efficient way to obtain the solutions because we need to find the inverse of the coefficient matrix only once.

73,73,10.6,Determinants and Cramer's Rule,682,Determinant of Matrix Determinant of an Matrix Row and Column Transformations Cramers Rule Areas of Triangles Using Determinants If matrix is square (that is if it has the same number of rows as columns) then we can assign to it number called its determinant. Determinants can be used to solve systems of linear equations as we will see later in this section. They are also useful in determin- ing whether matrix has an inverse. Determinant of Matrix We denote the determinant of square matrix by the symbol det1A2 or We first de- fine det1A2 for the simplest cases. If is matrix then det1A2 a. The fol- lowing box gives the definition of determinant. Determinant of an Matrix To define the concept of determinant for an arbitrary matrix we need the follow- ing terminology. MINORS AND COFACTORS Let be an matrix. 1. The minor ij of the element ij is the determinant of the matrix obtained by deleting the ith row and jth column of A. 2. The cofactor ij of the element ij is hen the minor 12 is the determinant of the matrix obtained by deleting the first row and second column from A. Thus 12 0162 4122 So the cofactor 12 112 12 12 Similarly 33 So 33 112 33 33 4. Note that the cofactor of ij is simply the minor of ij multiplied by either or depending on whether is even or odd. Thus in matrix we obtain the cofac- tor of any element by prefixing its minor with the sign obtained from the following checkerboard pattern. We are now ready to define the determinant of any square matrix. THE DETERMINANT OF SQUARE MATRIX If is an matrix then the determinant of is obtained by multiplying each element of the first row by its cofactor and then adding the results. In symbols In our definition of the determinant we used the cofactors of elements in the first row only. This is called expanding the determinant by the first row. In fact we can expand the determinant by any row or column in the same way and obtain the same result in each case (although we wont prove this). The next example illustrates this principle. The following criterion allows us to determine whether square matrix has an inverse without actually calculating the inverse. This is one of the most important uses of the determinant in matrix algebra and it is the reason for the name determinant. INVERTIBILIT CRITERION If is square matrix then has an inverse if and only if det1A2 0. We will not prove this fact but from the formula for the inverse of matrix (page 674) you can see why it is true in the case. Row and Column Transformations The preceding example shows that if we expand determinant about row or column that contains many zeros our work is reduced considerably because we dont have to eval- uate the cofactors of the elements that are zero. The following principle often simplifies the process of finding determinant by introducing zeros into the matrix without chang- ing the value of the determinant. ROW AND COLUMN TRANSFORMATIONS OF DETERMINANT If is square matrix and if the matrix is obtained from by adding multiple of one row to another or multiple of one column to another then det1A2 detB. Cramers Rule The solutions of linear equations can sometimes be expressed by using determinants. To il- lustrate lets solve the following pair of linear equations for the variable x. To eliminate the variable we multiply the first equation by and the second by and subtract. adx bdy rd bcx bdy bs adx bcx rd bs Factoring the left-hand side we get 1ad bc2x rd bs. Assuming that ad bc we can now solve this equation for x: rd bs ad bc as cr ad bc Similarly we find The numerator and denominator of the fractions for and are determinants of matrices. So we can express the solution of the system using determinants as follows.

74,74,10.7,Partial Fractions,693,Distinct Linear Factors Repeated Linear Factors Irreducible Quadratic Factors Repeated Irreducible Quadratic Factors Common denominator 3x 2x 2x Partial fractions To write sum or difference of fractional expressions as single fraction we bring them to common denominator. For example 12x 12 1x 12 3x 2x 1x 12 12x 12 2x But for some applications of algebra to calculus we must reverse this processthat is we must express fraction such as 3x12x 12 as the sum of the simpler fractions 11x 12 and 112x 12. These simpler fractions are called partial fractions we learn how to find them in this section. Let be the rational function r1x2 P1x2 Q1x2 where the degree of is less than the degree of Q. By the Linear and Quadratic Factors Theorem in Section 3.6 every polynomial with real coefficients can be factored com- pletely into linear and irreducible quadratic factors that is factors of the form ax and ax bx where and are real numbers. For instance 1x 12 1x 12 1x 12 1x 12 1x 12 After we have completely factored the denominator of we can express r1x2 as sum of partial fractions of the form 1ax b2 and Ax 1ax bx c2 This sum is called the partial fraction decomposition of r. Lets examine the details of the four possible cases. Distinct Linear Factors We first consider the case in which the denominator factors into distinct linear factors. CASE 1: THE DENOMINATOR IS PRODUCT OF DISTINCT LINEAR FACTORS Suppose that we can factor Q1x2 as Q1x2 1a 1a 1a with no factor repeated. In this case the partial fraction decomposition of P1x2Q1x2 takes the form Repeated Linear Factors We now consider the case in which the denominator factors into linear factors some of which are repeated. CASE 2: THE DENOMINATOR IS PRODUCT OF LINEAR FACTORS SOME OF WHICH ARE REPEATED Suppose the complete factorization of Q1x2 contains the linear factor ax repeated times that is ax is factor of Q1x2 Then corresponding to each such factor the partial fraction decomposition for P1x2Q1x2 contains Irreducible Quadratic Factors We now consider the case in which the denominator has distinct irreducible quadratic factors. CASE 3: THE DENOMINATOR HAS IRREDUCIBLE QUADRATIC FACTORS NONE OF WHICH IS REPEATED Suppose the complete factorization of Q1x2 contains the quadratic factor ax bx (which cant be factored further). Then corresponding to this the partial fraction decomposition of P1x2Q1x2 will have term of the form Repeated Irreducible Quadratic Factors We now consider the case in which the denominator has irreducible quadratic factors some of which are repeated. CASE 4: THE DENOMINATOR HAS REPEATED IRREDUCIBLE QUADRATIC FACTOR Suppose the complete factorization of Qx contains the factor ax bx where ax bx cant be factored further.

76,76,10.9,Systems of Inequalities,703,Graphing an Inequality Systems of Inequalities Systems of Linear Inequalities Application: Feasible Regions In this section we study systems of inequalities in two variables from graphical point of view. Graphing an Inequality FIGURE We begin by considering the graph of single inequality. We already know that the graph of for example is the parabola in Figure 1. If we replace the equal sign by the symbol we obtain the inequality Its graph consists of not just the parabola in Figure but also every point whose y-coordinate is larger than We indicate the solution in Figure 2(a) by shading the points above the parabola. Similarly the graph of in Figure 2(b) consists of all points on and below the parabola. However the graphs of and do not include the points on the parabola itself as indicated by the dashed curves in Figures 2(c) and 2(d). The graph of an inequality in general consists of region in the plane whose bound- ary is the graph of the equation obtained by replacing the inequality sign 1( or +2 with an equal sign. To determine which side of the graph gives the solution set of the in- equality we need only check test points GRAPHING INEQUALITIES To graph an inequality we carry out the following steps. Graph the equation corresponding to the inequality. Use dashed curve for or and solid curve for or (. 2. Test Points. Test one point in each region formed by the graph in Step 1. If the point satisfies the inequality then all the points in that region satisfy the inequal- ity. (In that case shade the region to indicate that it is part of the graph.) If the test point does not satisfy the inequality then the region isnt part of the graph. Systems of Inequalities We now consider systems of inequalities. The solution of such system is the set of all points in the coordinate plane that satisfy every inequality in the system. Systems of Linear Inequalities An inequality is linear if it can be put into one of the following forms: ax by ax by ax by ax by In the next example we graph the solution set of system of linear inequalities. Application: Feasible Regions Many applied problems involve constraints on the variables. For instance factory man- ager has only certain number of workers who can be assigned to perform jobs on the factory floor. farmer deciding what crops to cultivate has only certain amount of land that can be seeded. Such constraints or limitations can usually be expressed as systems of inequalities. When dealing with applied inequalities we usually refer to the solution set of system as feasible region because the points in the solution set represent feasible (or possible) values for the quantities being studied. ,Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Floor and ceiling functions|Plane (geometry)|Plane (geometry)|Inequality (mathematics)|Inequality (mathematics)|Inequality (mathematics)|Inequality (mathematics)|Inequality (mathematics)|Inequality (mathematics)|Inequality (mathematics)|Inequality (mathematics)|Inequality (mathematics)|Inequality (mathematics)|Inequality (mathematics)|Inequality (mathematics)|Inequality (mathematics)|Inequality (mathematics)|Inequality (mathematics)|Inequality (mathematics)|Inequality (mathematics)|Inequality (mathematics)|Inequality (mathematics)|Inequality (mathematics)|Inequality (mathematics)|Inequality (mathematics)|Inequality (mathematics)|Mereology|Mereology|Limit (mathematics)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Continuous function|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|System of linear equations|System of linear equations|System of linear equations|System of linear equations|Set (mathematics)|Set (mathematics)|Set (mathematics)|Set (mathematics)|Set (mathematics)|Sign (mathematics)|Sign (mathematics)|Sign (mathematics)|Equation|Equation|Universal quantification|Universal quantification|Universal quantification|Coordinate system|Number|Determinant|Equality (mathematics)|Equality (mathematics)|Equality (mathematics)|Basis (linear algebra)|Linear inequality|Linear inequality|Linear inequality|Expression (mathematics)|Curve|Curve|Curve|Limit of a function|Factorization|Factorization|Homogeneous polynomial|Homogeneous polynomial|List of mathematical symbols|Equality|Equality|Equality
77,77,11,CONIC SECTIONS,723,Conic sections are the curves we get when we make straight cut in cone as shown in the figure. For example if cone is cut horizontally the cross section is circle. So circle is conic section. Other ways of cutting cone produce parabolas ellipses and hyperbolas Our goal in this chapter is to find equations whose graphs are the conic sections. We already know from Section 1.8 that the graph of the equation is circle. We will find equations for each of the other conic sections by analyzing their geometric properties. The conic sections have interesting properties that make them useful for many real-world applications. For instance reflecting surface with parabolic cross-sections concentrates light at single point. This property of parabola is used in the construction of solar power plants like the one in California pic- tured above ,Cone|Cone|Cone|Cone|Cone|Cone|Cone|Cone|Hyperbola|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Point (geometry)|Circle|Circle|Circle|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Conic section|Conic section|Conic section|Conic section|Conic section|Equation|Equation|Equation|Curve|Exponentiation|Geometry|Line (geometry)
78,78,11.1,Parabolas,724,Geometric Definition of Parabola Equations and Graphs of Parabolas Applications Geometric Definition of Parabola We saw in Section 3.1 that the graph of the equation ax bx is U-shaped curve called parabola that opens either upward or downward depending on whether the sign of is positive or negative. In this section we study parabolas from geometric rather than an algebraic point of view. We begin with the geometric definition of parabola and show how this leads to the algebraic formula that we are already familiar with. GEOMETRIC DEFINITION OF PARABOLA parabola is the set of points in the plane that are equidistant from fixed point (called the focus and fixed line (called the directrix ). This definition is illustrated in Figure 1. The vertex of the parabola lies halfway be- tween the focus and the directrix and the axis of symmetry is the line that runs through the focus perpendicular to the directrix. Axis Parabola Focus FIGURE P(x y) yp FIGURE Directrix In this section we restrict our attention to parabolas that are situated with the vertex at the origin and that have vertical or horizontal axis of symmetry. (Parabolas in more general positions will be considered in Sections 11.4 and 11.5.) If the focus of such parabola is the point F10 p2 then the axis of symmetry must be vertical and the directrix has the equation p. Figure illustrates the case 0. If P1x y2 is any point on the parabola then the distance from to the focus (using the Distance Formula) is By the definition of parabola these two distances must be equal: 2x p2 p2 1y p2 2py 2py 2py 2py Square both sides Expand Simplify 4py If then the parabola opens upward but if it opens downward. When is re- placed by the equation remains unchanged so the graph is symmetric about the y-axis. Equations and Graphs of Parabolas The following box summarizes what we have just proved about the equation and features of parabola with vertical axis. PARABOLA WITH VERTICAL AXIS The graph of the equation 4py is parabola with the following properties. vertex V10 02 focus F10 p2 directrix The parabola opens upward if or downward if 0. Applications Parabolas have an important property that makes them useful as reflectors for lamps and telescopes. Light from source placed at the focus of surface with parabolic cross sec- tion will be reflected in such way that it travels parallel to the axis of the parabola (see Figure 9). Thus parabolic mirror reflects the light into beam of parallel rays. Con- versely light approaching the reflector in rays parallel to its axis of symmetry is concen- trated to the focus. This reflection property which can be proved by using calculus is used in the construction of reflecting telescopes. ,Calculus|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Plane (geometry)|Focus (geometry)|Focus (geometry)|Focus (geometry)|Focus (geometry)|Focus (geometry)|Focus (geometry)|Focus (geometry)|Focus (geometry)|Focus (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Algebra|Algebra|Inverse trigonometric functions|Open set|Open set|Open set|Open set|Square (algebra)|Mathematical proof|Mathematical proof|Angle|Angle|Angle|Angle|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Perpendicular|System of linear equations|Conic section|Conic section|Conic section|Conic section|Conic section|Conic section|Set (mathematics)|Sign (mathematics)|Sign (mathematics)|Sign (mathematics)|Sign (mathematics)|Algebraic expression|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Origin (mathematics)|Symmetry|Symmetry|Symmetry|Symmetry|Symmetry|Position (vector)|Position (vector)|Matrix (mathematics)|Derivative|Derivative|Equality (mathematics)|Formula|Formula|Parallel (geometry)|Parallel (geometry)|Parallel (geometry)|Curve|Distance|Distance|Distance|Distance|Geometry|Geometry|Geometry|Geometry|Geometry|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Equality
79,79,11.2,Ellipses,732,Geometric Definition of an Ellipse Equations and Graphs of Ellipses Eccentricity of an Ellipse Geometric Definition of an Ellipse An ellipse is an oval curve that looks like an elongated circle. More precisely we have the following definition. GEOMETRIC DEFINITION OF AN ELLIPSE An ellipse is the set of all points in the plane the sum of whose distances from two fixed points and is constant. (See Figure 1.) These two fixed points are the foci (plural of focus of the ellipse. The geometric definition suggests simple method for drawing an ellipse. Place sheet of paper on drawing board and insert thumbtacks at the two points that are to be the foci of the ellipse. Attach the ends of string to the tacks as shown in Figure 2(a). With the point of pencil hold the string taut. Then carefully move the pencil around the foci keeping the string taut at all times. The pencil will trace out an ellipse because the sum of the distances from the point of the pencil to the foci will always equal the length of the string which is constant. If the string is only slightly longer than the distance between the foci then the ellipse that is traced out will be elongated in shape as in Figure 2(a) but if the foci are close together relative to the length of the string the ellipse will be almost circular as shown in Figure 2(b). (a) (b) FIGURE F(c 0) To obtain the simplest equation for an ellipse we place the foci on the x-axis at 1c 02 and 1c 02 so that the origin is halfway between them (see Figure 3). For later convenience we let the sum of the distances from point on the ellipse to the foci be 2a. Then if P1x y2 is any point on the ellipse we have P(x y) F(c 0) d1P d1P 2a So from the Distance Formula we have 21x c2 21x c2 2a FIGURE 21x c2 2a 21x c2 or Squaring each side and expanding we get 2cx 4a 4a21x c2 1x 2cx which simplifies to 4a21x 4a 4cx Dividing each side by and squaring again we get 1x c2 1a cx 2a cx 2a cx 1a 2x 1a Since the sum of the distances from to the foci must be larger than the distance between the foci we have that 2a 2c or c. Thus and we can divide each side of the preceding equation by 1a to get For convenience let 1with 02. Since it follows that a. The preceding equation then becomes Equations and Graphs of Ellipses The following box summarizes what we have just proved about the equation and features of an ellipse centered at the origin. ELLIPSE WITH CENTER AT THE ORIGIN The graph of each of the following equations is an ellipse with center at the ori- gin and having the given properties. 1&a 02 Horizontal length 2a Vertical length 2b 1&c 02 equation In the standard equation for an ellipse is the larger denominator and is the smaller. To find we subtract: larger denominator minus smaller denominator. vertices major axis minor axis foci graph 10 &a2 Vertical length 2a Horizontal length 2b 10 &c2 Eccentricity of an Ellipse We saw earlier in this section (Figure 2) that if 2a is only slightly greater than 2c the el- lipse is long and thin whereas if 2a is much greater than 2c the ellipse is almost circu- lar. We measure the deviation of an ellipse from being circular by the ratio of and c. DEFINITION OF ECCENTRICIT For the ellipse is the number or 1with 02 the eccentricity where 2a The eccentricity of every ellipse satisfies 1. Thus if is close to then is almost equal to and the ellipse is elongated in shape but if is close to then the ellipse is close to circle in shape. The eccentricity is mea- sure of how stretched the ellipse is. In Figure we show number of ellipses to demonstrate the effect of varying the ec- centricity e. Gravitational attraction causes the planets to move in elliptical orbits around the sun with the sun at one focus. This remarkable property was first observed by Johannes Kepler and was later deduced by Isaac Newton from his inverse square Law of Gravity using calculus. The orbits of the planets have different eccentricities but most are nearly circular (see the margin). Ellipses like parabolas have an interesting reflection property that leads to number of practical applications. If light source is placed at one focus of reflecting surface with elliptical cross sections then all the light will be reflected off the surface to the other focus as shown in Figure 10. This principle which works for sound waves as well as for light is used in lithotripsy treatment for kidney stones. The patient is placed in tub of water with elliptical cross sections in such way that the kidney stone is accurately lo- cated at one focus. High-intensity sound waves generated at the other focus are reflected to the stone and destroy it with minimal damage to surrounding tissue. The patient is spared the trauma of surgery and recovers within days instead of weeks. The reflection property of ellipses is also used in the construction of whispering gal- leries. Sound coming from one focus bounces off the walls and ceiling of an elliptical room and passes through the other focus. In these rooms even quiet whispers spoken at one focus can be heard clearly at the other. Famous whispering galleries include the Na- tional Statuary Hall of the U.S. Capitol in Washington D.C. (see page 776) and the Mor- mon Tabernacle in Salt Lake City Utah. ,Calculus|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Floor and ceiling functions|Plane (geometry)|Inequality (mathematics)|Inequality (mathematics)|Focus (geometry)|Focus (geometry)|Focus (geometry)|Focus (geometry)|Focus (geometry)|Focus (geometry)|Focus (geometry)|Focus (geometry)|Focus (geometry)|Semi-major axis|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Eccentricity (mathematics)|Eccentricity (mathematics)|Eccentricity (mathematics)|Eccentricity (mathematics)|Eccentricity (mathematics)|Eccentricity (mathematics)|Subtraction|Subtraction|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Continuous function|Ellipse|Ellipse|Ellipse|Ellipse|Circle|Circle|Closed set|Closed set|Closed set|Closed set|Square (algebra)|Square (algebra)|Square (algebra)|Maxima and minima|Mathematical proof|Mathematical proof|Sum|Sum|Sum|Sum|Summation|Summation|Summation|Summation|Angle|Angle|Angle|Semi-minor axis|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Division (mathematics)|Division (mathematics)|System of linear equations|System of linear equations|Set (mathematics)|Length|Length|Length|Length|Length|Length|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Universal quantification|Universal quantification|Universal quantification|Origin (mathematics)|Origin (mathematics)|Origin (mathematics)|Number|Number|Number|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Derivative|Force|E (mathematical constant)|Equality (mathematics)|Equality (mathematics)|Formula|Work (physics)|Empty sum|Empty sum|Empty sum|Empty sum|Curve|Distance|Distance|Distance|Distance|Distance|Distance|Distance|Geometry|Geometry|Geometry|Geometry|Minor (linear algebra)|Equality|Equality
80,80,11.3,Hyperbolas,741,"Geometric Definition of Hyperbola Equations and Graphs of Hyperbolas Geometric Definition of Hyperbola Although ellipses and hyperbolas have completely different shapes their definitions and equations are similar. Instead of using the sum of distances from two fixed foci as in the case of an ellipse we use the difference to define hyperbola. GEOMETRIC DEFINITION OF HYPERBOLA hyperbola is the set of all points in the plane the difference of whose dis- tances from two fixed points and is constant. (See Figure 1.) These two fixed points are the foci of the hyperbola. P(x y) F(c 0) F(c 0) is on the hyperbola if d1P d1P 2a As in the case of the ellipse we get the simplest equation for the hyperbola by placing the foci on the x-axis at 1&c 02 as shown in Figure 1. By definition if P1x y2 lies on the hyperbola then either d1P d1P or d1P d1P must equal some pos- itive constant which we call 2a. Thus we have or d1P d1P &2a 21x c2 21x c2 &2a Proceeding as we did in the case of the ellipse (Section 11.2) we simplify this to 1c 2x 1c From triangle PF in Figure we see that d1P d1P 2c It follows that 2a 2c or c. Thus so we can set We then simplify the last displayed equation to get This is the equation of the hyperbola. If we replace by or by in this equation it remains unchanged so the hyperbola is symmetric about both the x- and y-axes and about the origin. The x-intercepts are &a and the points 1a 02 and 1a are the ver- tices of the hyperbola. There is no y-intercept because setting in the equation of the hyperbola leads to which has no real solution. Furthermore the equation of the hyperbola implies that so thus and hence or a. This means that the hyperbola consists of two parts called its branches The segment joining the two vertices on the separate branches is the transverse axis of the hyperbola and the origin is called its center If we place the foci of the hyperbola on the y-axis rather than on the x-axis this has the effect of reversing the roles of and in the derivation of the equation of the hyperbola. This leads to hyperbola with vertical transverse axis. Equations and Graphs of Hyperbolas The main properties of hyperbolas are listed in the following box. HYPERBOLA WITH CENTER AT THE ORIGIN The graph of each of the following equations is hyperbola with center at the origin and having the given properties. equation VERTICES 1&a 02 1a 02 10 &a2 1a 02 TRANSVERSE AXIS Horizontal length 2a Vertical length 2a ASYMPTOTES ""& ""& 1&c 02 10 &c2 FOCI GRAPH F(c 0) F(c 0) F(0 c) The asymptotes mentioned in this box are lines that the hyperbola approaches for large values of and y. To find the asymptotes in the first case in the box we solve the equa- tion for to get 2x ""& As gets large gets closer to zero. In other words as we have 0. So for large the value of can be approximated as &1ba2x This shows that these lines are asymptotes of the hyperbola. Asymptotes are an essential aid for graphing hyperbola they help us to determine its shape. convenient way to find the asymptotes for hyperbola with horizontal trans- verse axis is to first plot the points 1a 02 1a 02 10 b2 and 10 b2 Then sketch hor- izontal and vertical segments through these points to construct rectangle as shown in Figure 2(a). We call this rectangle the central box of the hyperbola. The slopes of the di- agonals of the central box are &ba so by extending them we obtain the asymptotes &1ba2x as sketched in Figure 2(b). Finally we plot the vertices and use the as- ymptotes as guide in sketching the hyperbola shown in Figure 2(c). (A similar proce- dure applies to graphing hyperbola that has vertical transverse axis.) HOW TO SKETCH HYPERBOLA 1. Sketch the Central Box.

We restricted ourselves to these cases because these equations have the simplest form. In this section we consider conics whose vertices and cen- ters are not necessarily at the origin and we determine how this affects their equations. Shifting Graphs of Equations In Section 2.5 we studied transformations of functions that have the effect of shifting their graphs. In general for any equation in and if we replace by or by the graph of the new equation is simply the old graph shifted horizontally if is replaced by or by the graph is shifted vertically. The following box gives the details. SHIFTING GRAPHS OF EQUATIONS If and are positive real numbers then replacing by or by and replacing by or by has the following effect(s) on the graph of any equation in and y. Replacement How the graph is shifted 1. replaced by Right units 2. replaced by Left units Upward units Downward units 3. replaced by 4. replaced by Shifted Ellipses Lets apply horizontal and vertical shifting to the ellipse with equation whose graph is shown in Figure 1. If we shift it so that its center is at the point 1h k2 in- stead of at the origin then its equation becomes Shifted Parabolas Applying shifts to parabolas leads to the equations and graphs shown in Figure 3. Shifted Hyperbolas Applying shifts to hyperbolas leads to the equations and graphs shown in Figure 5. The General Equation of Shifted Conic If we expand and simplify the equations of any of the shifted conics illustrated in Figures and then we will always obtain an equation of the form Ax Cy Dx Ey where and are not both 0. Conversely if we begin with an equation of this form then we can complete the square in and to see which type of conic section the equa- tion represents. In some cases the graph of the equation turns out to be just pair of lines or single point or there might be no graph at all. These cases are called de- generate conics If the equation is not degenerate then we can tell whether it repre- sents parabola an ellipse or hyperbola simply by examining the signs of and as described in the box below. GENERAL EQUATION OF SHIFTED CONIC The graph of the equation 1. The orbit of each planet is an ellipse Ax Cy Dx Ey with the sun at one focus. 2. The line segment that joins the sun to planet sweeps out equal areas in equal time (see the figure). 3.

82,82,11.5,Rotation of Axes,757,Rotation of Axes General Equation of Conic The Discriminant In Section 11.4 we studied conics with equations of the form Ax Cy Dx Ey We saw that the graph is always an ellipse parabola or hyperbola with horizontal or ver- tical axes (except in the degenerate cases). In this section we study the most general second-degree equation We will see that the graph of an equation of this form is also conic. In fact by rotating the coordinate axes through an appropriate angle we can eliminate the term Bxy and then use our knowledge of conic sections to analyze the graph. P(x y) P(X Y) Rotation of Axes FIGURE In Figure the x- and y-axes have been rotated through an acute angle about the origin to produce new pair of axes which we call the X- and Y-axes. point that has coor- dinates 1x y2 in the old system has coordinates 1X Y2 in the new system. If we let de- note the distance of from the origin and let be the angle that the segment OP makes with the new X-axis then we can see from Figure (by considering the two right trian- gles in the figure) that FIGURE cos sin cos1u sin1u Using the Addition Formula for Cosine we see that cos1u f2 1cos cos sin sin f2 1r cos cos 1r sin sin cos sin Similarly we can apply the Addition Formula for Sine to the expression for to obtain sin cos f. By treating these equations for and as system of linear equa- tions in the variables and (see Exercise 35) we obtain expressions for and in terms of and as detailed in the following box. ROTATION OF AXES FORMULAS Suppose the x- and y-axes in coordinate plane are rotated through the acute an- gle to produce the X- and Y-axes as shown in Figure 1. Then the coordinates 1x and 1X Y2 of point in the xy- and the XY-planes are related as follows: EXAMPLE cos sin cos sin sin cos sin cos General Equation of Conic The method of Example can be used to transform any equation of the form Ax Bxy Cy Dx Ey into an equation in and that doesnt contain an XY-term by choosing an appropriate angle of rotation. To find the angle that works we rotate the axes through an angle and substitute for and using the Rotation of Axes Formulas: If we expand this and collect like terms we obtain an equation of the form AX BXY CY DX EY where cos sin cos sin 21C A2 sin cos B1cos sin sin sin cos cos cos sin sin cos To eliminate the XY-term we would like to choose so that that is Double-Angle Formulas sin 2f sin cos cos 2f cos sin 21C A2 sin cos B1cos sin Double-Angle Formulas for Sine and Cosine 1C A2 sin 2f cos 2f cos 2f 1A C2 sin 2f cot 2f Divide by sin 2f The preceding calculation proves the following theorem.

83,83,11.6,Polar Equations of Conics,765,Unified Geometric Description of Conics Polar Equations of Conics Unified Geometric Description of Conics Earlier in this chapter we defined parabola in terms of focus and directrix but we defined the ellipse and hyperbola in terms of two foci. In this section we give more unified treatment of all three types of conics in terms of focus and directrix. If we place the focus at the origin then conic section has simple polar equation. Moreover in po- lar form rotation of conics becomes simple matter. Polar equations of ellipses are cru- cial in the derivation of Keplers Laws (see page 754). EQUIVALENT DESCRIPTION OF CONICS Let be fixed point (the focus) fixed line (the directrix) and let be fixed positive number (the eccentricity). The set of all points such that the ra- tio of the distance from to to the distance from to is the constant is conic. That is the set of all points such that d1P F2 d1P is conic. The conic is parabola if an ellipse if or hyperbola if 1. Polar Equations of Conics In the proof we saw that the polar equation of the conic in Figure is e1d cos Solving for we get ed cos If the directrix is chosen to be to the left of the focus 1x then we get the equation ed11 cos If the directrix is parallel to the polar axis 1y or d2 then we get sin instead of cos in the equation. These observations are summarized in the following box and in Figure 2. POLAR EQUATIONS OF CONICS polar equation of the form ed cos or ed sin represents conic with one focus at the origin and with eccentricity e. The conic is 1. parabola if 2. an ellipse if 3. hyperbola if To graph the polar equation of conic we first determine the location of the directrix from the form of the equation. The four cases that arise are shown in Figure 2. (The figure shows only the parts of the graphs that are close to the focus at the origin. The shape of the rest of the graph depends on whether the equation represents parabola an ellipse or hyperbola.) The axis of conic is perpendicular to the directrixspecifically we have the following: 1. For parabola the axis of symmetry is perpendicular to the directrix. 2. For an ellipse the major axis is perpendicular to the directrix. 3. For hyperbola the transverse axis is perpendicular to the directrix. ,Cone|Cone|Cone|Cone|Cone|Cone|Cone|Cone|Cone|Cone|Cone|Cone|Cone|Cone|Cone|Cone|Cone|Hyperbola|Hyperbola|Hyperbola|Hyperbola|Hyperbola|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Sine|Sine|Focus (geometry)|Focus (geometry)|Focus (geometry)|Focus (geometry)|Focus (geometry)|Focus (geometry)|Focus (geometry)|Semi-major axis|Mereology|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Eccentricity (mathematics)|Eccentricity (mathematics)|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Rotation (mathematics)|Closed set|Mathematical proof|Mathematical proof|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Perpendicular|Conic section|Conic section|Conic section|Conic section|Conic section|Conic section|Conic section|Conic section|Conic section|Conic section|Conic section|Conic section|Conic section|Conic section|Conic section|Conic section|Conic section|Conic section|Conic section|Conic section|Conic section|Conic section|Conic section|Conic section|Conic section|Conic section|Set (mathematics)|Set (mathematics)|Sign (mathematics)|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Equation|Universal quantification|Universal quantification|Universal quantification|Origin (mathematics)|Origin (mathematics)|Origin (mathematics)|Symmetry|Position (vector)|Number|Determinant|Derivative|Derivative|E (mathematical constant)|Parallel (geometry)|Distance|Distance|Geometry|Geometry|Homogeneous polynomial|Homogeneous polynomial|Homogeneous polynomial|Line (geometry)

This sequence has definite pattern describing the pattern allows us to predict the height that the ball reaches after any number of bounces. The amount in bank account at the end of each month mortgage payments and the amount of an annuity are also sequences.

85,85,12.1,Sequences and Summation Notation,784,"Sequences Recursively Defined Sequences The Partial Sums of Sequence Sigma Notation Roughly speaking sequence is an infinite list of numbers. The numbers in the sequence are often written as The dots mean that the list continues forever. simple example is the sequence 10 15 20 25 We can describe the pattern of the sequence displayed above by the following formula: 5n You may have already thought of different way to describe the patternnamely you go from one number to the next by adding 5. This natural way of describing the sequence is expressed by the recursive formula: n""1 starting with 5. Try substituting in each of these formulas to see how they produce the numbers in the sequence. In this section we see how these different ways are used to describe specific sequences. Sequences Any ordered list of numbers can be viewed as function whose input values are and whose output values are the numbers in the list. So we define sequence as follows: DEFINITION OF SEQUENCE sequence is function whose domain is the set of natural numbers. The terms of the sequence are the function values 11 12 13 1n We usually write instead of the function notation 1n So the terms of the se- quence are written as The number is called the first term is called the second term and in gen- eral is called the nth term. Here is simple example of sequence: 10 Another way to write this sequence is to use function notation: a1n2 2n so a112 a122 a13 We can write sequence in this way when its clear what the subsequent terms of the se- quence are. This sequence consists of even numbers. To be more accurate however we need to specify procedure for finding all the terms of the sequence. This can be done by giving formula for the nth term of the sequence. In this case nd the sequence can be written as 1st term 2nd term 3rd term 4th term 2n nth term Notice how the formula 2n gives all the terms of the sequence. For instance substi- tuting and for gives the first four terms: To find the 103rd term of this sequence we use 103 to get Can you detect pattern in these numbers? In other words can you define sequence whose first four terms are these numbers? The answer to this question seems easy these numbers are the squares of the numbers 4. Thus the sequence we are looking for is defined by However this is not the only sequence whose first four terms are 16. In other words the answer to our problem is not unique (see Exercise 80). In the next example we are interested in finding an obvious sequence whose first few terms agree with the given ones. The Partial Sums of Sequence In calculus we are often interested in adding the terms of sequence. This leads to the fol- lowing definition. THE PARTIAL SUMS OF SEQUENCE For the sequence the partial sums are is called the first partial sum is the second partial sum and so on. is called the nth partial sum. The sequence is called the se- quence of partial sums. Sigma Notation Given sequence This tells us to end with This tells us to add we can write the sum of the first terms using summation notation or sigma notation. This notation derives its name from the Greek letter (capital sigma corresponding to our for sum). Sigma notation is used as follows: k1 This tells us to start with k1 The left side of this expression is read The sum of from to n. The letter is called the index of summation or the summation variable and the idea is to replace in the expression after the sigma by the integers and add the resulting ex- pressions arriving at the right side of the equation.

86,86,12.2,Arithmetic Sequences,794,Arithmetic Sequences Partial Sums of Arithmetic Sequences In this section we study special type of sequence called an arithmetic sequence. Arithmetic Sequences Perhaps the simplest way to generate sequence is to start with number and add to it fixed constant over and over again. DEFINITION OF AN ARITHMETIC SEQUENCE An arithmetic sequence is sequence of the form 2d 3d 4d The number is the first term and is the common difference of the sequence. The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by 1n 12d The number is called the common difference because any two consecutive terms of an arithmetic sequence differ by d. Partial Sums of Arithmetic Sequences Suppose we want to find the sum of the numbers 100 that is 100 k1 When the famous mathematician C. F. Gauss was schoolboy his teacher posed this prob- lem to the class and expected that it would keep the students busy for long time. But Gauss answered the question almost immediately. His idea was this: Since we are adding numbers produced according to fixed pattern there must also be pattern (or formula) for finding the sum. He started by writing the numbers from to 100 and then below them wrote the same numbers in reverse order. Writing for the sum and adding corresponding terms give 98 99 100 100 99 98 2S 101 101 101 101 101 101 It follows that 2S 10011012 10100 and so 5050. Of course the sequence of natural numbers is an arithmetic sequence (with and 1) and the method for summing the first 100 terms of this sequence can be used to find formula for the nth partial sum of any arithmetic sequence. We want to find the sum of the first terms of the arithmetic sequence whose terms are 1k 12d that is we want to find There are identical terms on the right side of this equation so 2S n32a 1n 12d4 32a 1n 12d4 Notice that 1n 12d is the nth term of this sequence. So we can write 3a 1n 12d4 This last formula says that the sum of the first terms of an arithmetic sequence is the av- erage of the first and nth terms multiplied by the number of terms in the sum. We now summarize this result. PARTIAL SUMS OF AN ARITHMETIC SEQUENCE For the arithmetic sequence 1n 12 the nth partial sum 1a d2 1a 2d2 1a 3d2 3a 1n 12d4 is given by either of the following formulas. ,Subtraction|Subtraction|Subtraction|Continuous function|Identity (mathematics)|Series (mathematics)|Series (mathematics)|Series (mathematics)|Series (mathematics)|Series (mathematics)|Natural number|Sum|Sum|Sum|Sum|Sum|Sum|Sum|Sum|Sum|Sum|Sum|Sum|Summation|Summation|Summation|Summation|Summation|Summation|Summation|Summation|Summation|Summation|Summation|Summation|Graph (mathematics)|Equation|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Multiplication|Addition|Derivative|Derivative|Derivative|Derivative|Formula|Formula|Formula|Formula|Empty sum|Empty sum|Empty sum|Empty sum|Empty sum|Empty sum|Empty sum|Empty sum|Empty sum|Empty sum|Empty sum|Empty sum|Differential equation|Arithmetic|Arithmetic|Arithmetic|Arithmetic|Arithmetic|Arithmetic|Arithmetic|Arithmetic|Arithmetic|Arithmetic|Arithmetic|Arithmetic|Arithmetic|Arithmetic|Arithmetic|Homogeneous polynomial
87,87,12.3,Geometric Sequences,800,"Geometric Sequences Partial Sums of Geometric Sequences What Is an Infinite Series? Infinite Geometric Series In this section we study geometric sequences. This type of sequence occurs frequently in applications to finance population growth and other fields. Geometric Sequences Recall that an arithmetic sequence is generated when we repeatedly add number to an initial term a. geometric sequence is generated when we start with number and re- peatedly multiply by fixed nonzero constant r. DEFINITION OF GEOMETRIC SEQUENCE geometric sequence is sequence of the form ar ar ar ar The number is the first term and is the common ratio of the sequence. The nth term of geometric sequence is given by ar n""1 The number is called the common ratio because the ratio of any two consecutive terms of the sequence is r. Geometric sequences occur naturally. Here is simple example. Suppose ball has elasticity such that when it is dropped it bounces up one-third of the distance it has fallen. If this ball is dropped from height of then it bounces up to height of 2A 13 23 On its second bounce it returns to height of 23 BA 13 29 and so on (see Figure 2). Thus the height that the ball reaches on its nth bounce is given by the geometric sequenc Partial Sums of Geometric Sequences PARTIAL SUMS OF GEOMETRIC SEQUENCE For the geometric sequence ar n""1 the nth partial sum ar ar ar ar ar n""1 is given by What Is an Infinite Series? An expression of the form k1 is called an infinite series. The dots mean that we are to continue the addition indefinitely. What meaning can we attach to the sum of infinitely many numbers? It seems at first that it is not possible to add infinitely many numbers and arrive at finite number. But consider the following problem. You have cake and you want to eat it by first eating half the cake then eating half of what remains then again eating half of what remains. This process can continue indefinitely because at each stage some of the cake remains. (See Figure 3.) 16 FIGURE 16 32 Does this mean that its impossible to eat all of the cake? Of course not. Lets write down what you have eaten from this cake: 16 k1 This is an infinite series and we note two things about it: First from Figure its clear that no matter how many terms of this series we add the total will never exceed 1. Sec- ond the more terms of this series we add the closer the sum is to (see Figure 3). This suggests that the number can be written as the sum of infinitely many smaller numbers: 16 To make this more precise lets look at the partial sums of this series: 16 15 16 and in general (see Example of Section 12.1) As gets larger and larger we are adding more and more of the terms of this series. In- tuitively as gets larger gets closer to the sum of the series. Now notice that as gets large 12 gets closer and closer to 0. Thus gets close to 1. Using the notation of Section 3.7 we can write as In general if gets close to finite number as gets large we say that the infinite se- ries converges (or is convergent). The number is called the sum of the infinite series. If an infinite series does not converge we say that the series diverges (or is divergent). Infinite Geometric Series Here is another way to arrive at the formula for the sum of an infinite geo- metric series: ar ar ar 1a ar ar An infinite geometric series is series of the form ar ar ar ar ar n""1 We can apply the reasoning used earlier to find the sum of an infinite geometric series. The nth partial sum of such series is given by the formula rS Solve the equation rS for to get rS 11 2S 1r 12 It can be shown that if then gets close to as gets large (you can easily con- vince yourself of this using calculator).

88,88,12.4,Mathematics of Finance,808,"The Amount of an Annuity The Present Value of an Annuity Installment Buying Many financial transactions involve payments that are made at regular intervals. For ex- ample if you deposit 100 each month in an interest-bearing account what will the value of your account be at the end of years? If you borrow 100000 to buy house how much must your monthly payments be in order to pay off the loan in 30 years? Each of these questions involves the sum of sequence of numbers we use the results of the pre- ceding section to answer them here. The Amount of an Annuity An annuity is sum of money that is paid in regular equal payments. Although the word annuity suggests annual (or yearly) payments they can be made semiannually quarterly monthly or at some other regular interval. Payments are usually made at the end of the payment interval. The amount of an annuity is the sum of all the individual payments from the time of the first payment until the last payment is made together with all the in- terest. We denote this sum by (the subscript here is used to denote final amount).4 AMOUNT OF AN ANNUIT The amount of an annuity consisting of regular equal payments of size with interest rate per time period is given by The Present Value of an Annuity If you were to receive 10000 five years from now it would be worth much less than if you got 10000 right now. This is because of the interest you could accumulate during the next five years if you invested the money now. What smaller amount would you be will- ing to accept now instead of receiving 10000 in five years? This is the amount of money that together with interest would be worth 10000 in five years. The amount that we are looking for here is called the discounted value or present value. If the interest rate is per year compounded quarterly then the interest per time period is 0.084 0.02 and there are 20 time periods. If we let PV denote the present value then by the for- mula for compound interest (Section 4.1) we have so 10000 PV11 PV11 0.022 20 PV 1000011 0.022 ""20 6729.713 Thus in this situation the present value of 10000 is 6729.71. This reasoning leads to general formula for present value. If an amount is to be paid in lump sum time periods from now and the interest rate per time period is then its present value is given by 11 ""n Similarly the present value of an annuity is the amount that must be invested now at the interest rate per time period to provide payments each of amount R. Clearly is the sum of the present values of each individual payment (see Exercise 29).

89,89,12.5,Mathematical Induction,814,Conjecture and Proof Mathematical Induction There are two aspects to mathematicsdiscovery and proofand they are of equal im- portance. We must discover something before we can attempt to prove it and we cannot be certain of its truth until it has been proved. In this section we examine the relationship between these two key components of mathematics more closely. Conjecture and Proof Lets try simple experiment. We add more and more of the odd numbers as follows: 16 25 What do you notice about the numbers on the right side of these equations? They are in fact all perfect squares. These equations say the following: This leads naturally to the following question: Is it true that for every natural number the sum of the first odd numbers is Could this remarkable property be true? We could try few more numbers and find that the pattern persists for the first and 10 odd num- bers. At this point we feel quite sure that this is always true so we make conjecture: The sum of the first odd numbers is Since we know that the nth odd number is 2n we can write this statement more pre- cisely as 12n 12 It is important to realize that this is still conjecture. We cannot conclude by checking finite number of cases that property is true for all numbers (there are infinitely many). To see this more clearly suppose someone tells us that he has added up the first trillion odd numbers and found that they do not add up to trillion squared. What would you tell this person? It would be silly to say that youre sure its true because you have already checked the first five cases. You could however take out paper and pencil and start check- ing it yourself but this task would probably take the rest of your life. The tragedy would be that after completing this task you would still not be sure of the truth of the conjec- ture Do you see why? Herein lies the power of mathematical proof. proof is clear argument that demon- strates the truth of statement beyond doubt. Mathematical Induction Lets consider special kind of proof called mathematical induction. Here is how it works: Suppose we have statement that says something about all natural numbers n. For example for any natural number let P1n2 be the following statement: P1n2 The sum of the first odd numbers is Since this statement is about all natural numbers it contains infinitely many statements we will call them P(1) P(2) P112: The sum of the first odd number is P122: The sum of the first odd numbers is P132: The sum of the first odd numbers is How can we prove all of these statements at once? Mathematical induction is clever way of doing just that. The crux of the idea is this: Suppose we can prove that whenever one of these state- ments is true then the one following it in the list is also true. In other words For every if P1k2 is true then P1k 12 is true This is called the induction step because it leads us from the truth of one statement to the truth of the next. Now suppose that we can also prove that P112 is true The induction step now leads us through the following chain of statements: P112 is true so P122 P122 is true so P132 P132 is true so P142 is true is true is true So we see that if both the induction step and P112 are proved then statement P1n2 is proved for all n. Here is summary of this important method of proof. PRINCIPLE OF MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION For each natural number let P1n2 be statement depending on n. Suppose that the following two conditions are satisfied. 1. P112 is true. 2. For every natural number if P1k2 is true then P1k 12 is true. Then P1n2 is true for all natural numbers n. To apply this principle there are two steps: Step Prove that P112 is true. Step Assume that P1k2 is true and use this assumption to prove that P1k 12 is true. Notice that in Step we do not prove that P1k is true. We only show that if P1k2 is true then P1k 12 is also true. The assumption that P1k2 is true is called the induction hypothesis. The following box gives formulas for the sums of powers of the first natural num- bers. These formulas are important in calculus. Formula is proved in Example 2. The other formulas are also proved by using mathematical induction (see Exercises and 9). SUMS OF POWERS 0. 2. 1. 3. k1 k1 k1 n1n 12 k1 n1n 12 12n 12 1n 12 It might happen that statement P1n2 is false for the first few natural numbers but true from some number on. For example we might want to prove that P1n2 is true for 5. Notice that if we prove that P152 is true then this fact together with the induction step would imply the truth of P152 P162 P172 The next example illustrates this point. ,Calculus|Mathematical induction|Mathematical induction|Mathematical induction|Mathematical induction|Mathematical induction|Mathematical induction|Mathematical induction|Mathematical induction|Mathematical induction|Mathematical induction|Mathematical induction|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Closed set|Square (algebra)|Square (algebra)|Mathematical proof|Mathematical proof|Mathematical proof|Mathematical proof|Mathematical proof|Mathematical proof|Mathematical proof|Mathematical proof|Mathematical proof|Mathematical proof|Mathematical proof|Mathematical proof|Mathematical proof|Mathematical proof|Mathematical proof|Mathematical proof|Mathematical proof|Mathematical proof|Mathematical proof|Mathematical proof|Natural number|Natural number|Natural number|Natural number|Natural number|Natural number|Natural number|Natural number|Sum|Sum|Sum|Sum|Sum|Sum|Sum|Sum|Summation|Summation|Summation|Summation|Summation|Summation|Summation|Summation|Equation|Equation|Universal quantification|Universal quantification|Universal quantification|Universal quantification|Universal quantification|Universal quantification|Universal quantification|Universal quantification|Universal quantification|Universal quantification|Universal quantification|Existential quantification|Existential quantification|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Number|Addition|Addition|Infinity|Infinity|Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix (mathematics)|Equality (mathematics)|Formula|Formula|Formula|Formula|Work (physics)|Empty sum|Empty sum|Empty sum|Empty sum|Empty sum|Empty sum|Empty sum|Empty sum|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Parity (mathematics)|Parity (mathematics)|Parity (mathematics)|Parity (mathematics)|Parity (mathematics)|Parity (mathematics)|Parity (mathematics)|Parity (mathematics)|Parity (mathematics)|Euclidean vector|Equality
90,90,12.6,The Binomial Theorem,820,Expanding (a b) The Binomial Coefficients The Binomial Theorem Proof of the Binomial Theorem An expression of the form is called binomial. Although in principle its easy to raise to any power raising it to very high power would be tedious. In this section we find formula that gives the expansion of 1a b2 for any natural number and then prove it using mathematical induction. Expanding (a b) To find pattern in the expansion of 1a b2 we first look at some special cases. 1a b2 1a b2 2ab 1a b2 3a 3ab 1a b2 4a 6a 4ab 1a b2 5a 10a 10a 5ab The following simple patterns emerge for the expansion of 1a b2 1. There are terms the first being and the last being 2. The exponents of decrease by from term to term while the exponents of in- crease by 1. 3. The sum of the exponents of and in each term is n. For instance notice how the exponents of and behave in the expansion of 1a b2 The exponents of decrease: 1a b2 5a 10a 10a 5a The exponents of increase: 1a b2 5a 10a 10a 5a With these observations we can write the form of the expansion of 1a b2 for any nat- ural number n. For example writing question mark for the missing coefficients we have ab To complete the expansion we need to determine these coefficients. To find pattern lets write the coefficients in the expansion of 1a b2 for the first few values of in trian- gular array as shown in the following array which is called Pascals triangle. 1a b2 1a b2 1a b2 1a b2 1a b2 1a b2 10 10 The row corresponding to 1a b2 is called the zeroth row and is included to show the sym- metry of the array. The key observation about Pascals triangle is the following property. KEY PROPERT OF PASCALS TRIANGLE Every entry (other than 1) is the sum of the two entries diagonally above it. From this property it is easy to find any row of Pascals triangle from the row above it. For instance we find the sixth and seventh rows starting with the fifth row: 1a b2 1a b2 10 10 1a b2 What we now call Pascals triangle appears in this Chinese document by Chu Shikie dated 1303. The title reads The Old Method Chart of the Seven Multiplying Squares.The triangle was rediscovered by Pascal (see page 818). 15 21 20 35 15 35 21 To see why this property holds lets consider the following expansions: 1a b2 5a 10a 10a 5ab 822 1a b2 6a 15a 20a 15a 6ab We arrive at the expansion of 1a b2 by multiplying 1a b2 by 1a b2 Notice for instance that the circled term in the expansion of 1a b2 is obtained via this multipli- cation from the two circled terms above it. We get this term when the two terms above it are multiplied by and respectively. Thus its coefficient is the sum of the coefficients of these two terms. We will use this observation at the end of this section when we prove the Binomial Theorem. Having found these patterns we can now easily obtain the expansion of any binomial at least to relatively small powers. The Binomial Coefficients Although Pascals triangle is useful in finding the binomial expansion for reasonably small values of it isnt practical for finding 1a b2 for large values of n. The reason is that the method we use for finding the successive rows of Pascals triangle is recursive. Thus to find the 100th row of this triangle We need to examine the pattern in the coefficients more carefully to develop formula that allows us to calculate directly any coefficient in the binomial expansion. Such for- mula exists and the rest of this section is devoted to finding and proving it. However to state this formula we need some notation. The product of the first natural numbers is denoted by and is called factorial. 1n 12 10 10 3628800 We also define as follows: This definition of makes many formulas involving factorials shorter and easier to write. THE BINOMIAL COEFFICIENT Let and be nonnegative integers with n. The binomial coefficient is de- noted by nr and is defined by r1n r2 To demonstrate that this pattern holds we need to show that any entry in this version of Pascals triangle is the sum of the two entries diagonally above it. In other words we must show that each entry satisfies the key property of Pascals triangle. We now state this prop- erty in terms of the binomial coefficients. KEY PROPERT OF THE BINOMIAL COEFFICIENTS For any nonnegative integers and with Notice that the two terms on the left-hand side of this equation are adjacent entries in the kth row of Pascals triangle and the term on the right-hand side is the entry diagonally below them in the 1k 12 st row.

91,91,13,LIMITS: A PREVIEW OF CALCULUS,839,In this chapter we study the central idea underlying calculus: the concept of limit. Calculus is used in modeling numerous real-life phenomena particularly situations that involve change or motion. Limits are used in finding the instan- taneous rate of change of function as well as the area of region with curved boundary. You will learn in calculus that these two apparently different prob- lems are closely related. In this chapter we see how limits allow us to solve both problems. In Chapter we learned how to find the average rate of change of func- tion. For example to find the average speed we divide the total distance trav- eled by the total time. But how can we find instantaneous speedthat is the speed at given instant? We cant divide the total distance by the total time be- cause in an instant the total distance traveled is zero and the total time spent traveling is zero But we can find the average rate of change on smaller and smaller intervals zooming in on the instant we want. In other words the in- stantaneous speed is limit of the average speeds. To find the area of region with curved sides we approximate the area by in- scribing polygons in the region. The figure illustrates how this is done for circle. If we let be the area of the inscribed polygon with sides then we see that as increases gets closer and closer to the area of the circle. In other words the area is the limit of the areas ,Calculus|Calculus|Calculus|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Subtraction|Circle|Circle|Closed set|Division (mathematics)|Division (mathematics)|Interval (mathematics)|Zero (complex analysis)|Zero (complex analysis)|Function (mathematics)|Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean|Derivative|Curve|Curve|Polygon|Polygon|Distance|Distance|Distance|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Area|Area|Area|Area|Area|Area|Area
92,92,13.1,Finding Limits Numerically and Graphically,840,Definition of Limit Estimating Limits Numerically and Graphically Limits That Fail to Exist One-Sided Limits In this section we use tables of values and graphs of functions to answer the question What happens to the values f1x2 of function as the variable approaches the number a? Definition of Limit We begin by investigating the behavior of the function defined by f1x2 for values of near 2. The following tables give values of f1x2 for values of close to but not equal to 2. 1.0 1.5 1.8 1.9 1.95 1.99 1.995 1.999 x22 2.000000 2.750000 3.440000 3.710000 3.852500 3.970100 3.985025 3.997001 x22 3.0 2.5 2.2 2.1 2.05 2.01 2.005 2.001 8.000000 5.750000 4.640000 4.310000 4.152500 4.030100 4.015025 4.003001 approaches y-x+2 as approaches FIGURE From the table and the graph of (a parabola) shown in Figure we see that when is close to (on either side of 2) f1x2 is close to 4. In fact it appears that we can make the values of 1x2 as close as we like to by taking sufficiently close to 2. We express this by saying the limit of the function f1x as approaches is equal to 4. The notation for this is lim 1x 22 xS2 In general we use the following notation. DEFINITION OF THE LIMIT OF FUNCTION We write lim f1x2 xSa and say the limit of f1x2 as approaches equals if we can make the values of f1x2 arbitrarily close to (as close to as we like) by taking to be sufficiently close to but not equal to a. Roughly speaking this says that the values of f1x2 get closer and closer to the number as gets closer and closer to the number (from either side of a) but a. An alternative notation for lim xSa f1x2 is f1x2 as which is usually read f1x approaches as approaches a. This is the notation we used in Section 3.7 when discussing asymptotes of rational functions. Notice the phrase but in the definition of limit. This means that in finding the limit of f1x2 as approaches we never consider a. In fact f1x2 need not even be defined when a. The only thing that matters is how is defined near a. Figure shows the graphs of three functions. Note that in part (c) f1a2 is not defined and in part (b) f1a2 But in each case regardless of what happens at lim xSa f1x2 Estimating Limits Numerically and Graphically In Section 13.2 we will develop techniques for finding exact values of limits. For now we use tables and graphs to estimate limits of functions. Limits That Fail to Exist Functions do not necessarily approach finite value at every point. In other words its possible for limit not to exist. The next three examples illustrate ways in which this can happen. One-Sided Limits We noticed in Example that H1t2 approaches as approaches from the left and H1t2 approaches as approaches from the right. We indicate this situation symbolically by writing lim H1t2 tS0 and lim H1t tS0 The symbol indicates that we consider only values of that are less than 0. Like- wise indicates that we consider only values of that are greater than 0. DEFINITION OF ONE-SIDED LIMIT We write lim f1x2 xSa and say the left-hand limit of f1x2 as approaches or the limit of f1x2 as approaches from the left is equal to if we can make the values of f1x2 arbi- trarily close to by taking to be sufficiently close to and less than a. Notice that this definition differs from the definition of two-sided limit only in that we require to be less than a. Similarly if we require that be greater than we get the right-hand limit of x)) as approaches is equal to and we write lim f1x2 xSa Thus the symbol means that we consider only a. These definitions are il- lustrated in Figure 9. (a) lim FIGURE (b) lim By comparing the definitions of two-sided and one-sided limits we see that the fol- lowing is true. lim f1x2 if and only if xSa lim f1x2 and xSa lim 1x2 xSa Thus if the left-hand and right-hand limits are different the (two-sided) limit does not ex- ist. We use this fact in the next two examples. ,Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Rational function|Inequality (mathematics)|Inequality (mathematics)|Inequality (mathematics)|Inequality (mathematics)|Inequality (mathematics)|Inequality (mathematics)|Inequality (mathematics)|Mereology|Mereology|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Point (geometry)|Subtraction|Subtraction|Continuous function|Closed set|Closed set|Closed set|Closed set|Closed set|Closed set|Closed set|Closed set|Closed set|Closed set|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Exponential function|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Rationalisation (mathematics)|Existential quantification|Existential quantification|Existential quantification|Number|Number|Number|Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean|Linear equation|Derivative|Derivative|Equality (mathematics)|Equality (mathematics)|Equality (mathematics)|Equality (mathematics)|Equality (mathematics)|Equality (mathematics)|Expression (mathematics)|Asymptote|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Scientific notation|Scientific notation|Scientific notation|Scientific notation|List of mathematical symbols|List of mathematical symbols|List of mathematical symbols|Equality|Equality|Equality|Equality|Equality|Equality
93,93,13.2,Finding Limits Algebraically,848,Limit Laws Applying the Limit Laws Finding Limits Using Algebra and the Limit Laws Using Left- and Right-Hand Limits In Section 13.1 we used calculators and graphs to guess the values of limits but we saw that such methods dont always lead to the correct answer. In this section we use algebraic methods to find limits exactly. Limit Laws We use the following properties of limits called the Limit Laws to calculate limits. These five laws can be stated verbally as follows: Limit of Sum Limit of Difference Limit of Constant Multiple Limit of Product Limit of Quotient 1. The limit of sum is the sum of the limits. 2. The limit of difference is the difference of the limits. 3. The limit of constant times function is the constant times the limit of the function. 4. The limit of product is the product of the limits. 5. The limit of quotient is the quotient of the limits (provided that the limit of the denominator is not 0). Its easy to believe that these properties are true. For instance if f1x is close to and g1x2 is close to it is reasonable to conclude that f1x g1x is close to M. This gives us an intuitive basis for believing that Law is true. If we use Law (Limit of Product) repeatedly with g1x2 f1x we obtain the fol- lowing Law for the limit of power. similar law holds for roots. LIMIT LAWS Applying the Limit Laws In applying the Limit Laws we need to use four special limits. SOME SPECIAL LIMITS 1. lim xa 2. lim xa 3. lim where is positive integer xa 4. lim xa where is positive integer and Special Limits and are intuitively obviouslooking at the graphs of and will convince you of their validity. Limits and are special cases of Limit Laws and (Limits of Power and of Root). LIMITS BY DIRECT SUBSTITUTION If is polynomial or rational function and is in the domain of then lim f1x2 f1a2 xa Functions with this direct substitution property are called continuous at a. You will learn more about continuous functions when you study calculus. Finding Limits Using Algebra and the Limit Laws As we saw in Example evaluating limits by direct substitution is easy. But not all lim- its can be evaluated this way. In fact most of the situations in which limits are useful re- quire us to work harder to evaluate the limit. The next three examples illustrate how we can use algebra to find limits. Using Left- and Right-Hand Limits Some limits are best calculated by first finding the left- and right-hand limits. The fol- lowing theorem is reminder of what we discovered in Section 13.1. It says that two- sided limit exists if and only if both of the one-sided limits exist and are equal. ,Calculus|Graph of a function|Graph of a function|Rational function|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Subtraction|Subtraction|Subtraction|Algebra|Algebra|Algebra|Algebra|Continuous function|Continuous function|Domain of a function|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Product topology|Closed set|Closed set|Closed set|Natural number|Natural number|Sum|Sum|Sum|Summation|Summation|Summation|Graph (mathematics)|Graph (mathematics)|Polynomial|Sign (mathematics)|Sign (mathematics)|Universal quantification|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Rationalisation (mathematics)|Existential quantification|Existential quantification|Nth root|Nth root|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Product (mathematics)|Position (vector)|Position (vector)|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Multiplication|Derivative|Derivative|Derivative|Equality (mathematics)|Basis (linear algebra)|Work (physics)|Integer|Integer|Empty sum|Empty sum|Empty sum|Exponentiation|Exponentiation|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Change of variables|Change of variables|Change of variables|Equality
94,94,13.3,Tangent Lines and Derivatives,856,The Tangent Lines Derivatives Instantaneous Rates of Change In this section we see how limits arise when we attempt to find the tangent line to curve or the instantaneous rate of change of function. The Tangent Problem tangent line is line that just touches curve. For instance Figure shows the parabola and the tangent line that touches the parabola at the point P11 12 We will be able to find an equation of the tangent line as soon as we know its slope m. The difficulty is that we know only one point on whereas we need two points to compute the slope. But ob- serve that we can compute an approximation to by choosing nearby point Q1x on the parabola (as in Figure 2) and computing the slope PQ of the secant line PQ. If we have general curve with equation f1x2 and we want to find the tangent line to at the point P1a f1a22 then we consider nearby point Q1x f1x22 where and compute the slope of the secant line PQ. PQ f1x2 f1a2 Then we let approach along the curve by letting approach a. If PQ approaches number then we define the tangent to be the line through with slope m. (This amounts to saying that the tangent line is the limiting position of the secant line PQ as approaches P. See Figure 5.) DEFINITION OF TANGENT LINE The tangent line to the curve f1x2 at the point P1a 1a22 is the line through with slope f1x f1a2 xa lim provided that this limit exists. Derivatives We have seen that the slope of the tangent line to the curve f1x2 at the point 1a f1a22 can be written as lim h0 f1a h2 1a2 It turns out that this expression arises in many other contexts as well such as finding ve- locities and other rates of change. Because this type of limit occurs so widely it is given special name and notation. DEFINITION OF DERIVATIVE The derivative of function at number denoted by f1a2 is f1a h2 1a2 h0 f1a2 lim if this limit exists. Instantaneous Rates of Change In Section 2.3 we defined the average rate of change of function between the numbers and as average rate of change f1x f1a2 change in change in Suppose we consider the average rate of change over smaller and smaller intervals by let- ting approach a. The limit of these average rates of change is called the instantaneous rate of change. INSTANTANEOUS RATE OF CHANGE If f1x2 the instantaneous rate of change of with respect to at is the limit of the average rates of change as approaches a: instantaneous rate of change lim xa f1x2 f1a f1a2 Notice that we now have two ways of interpreting the derivative: f1a2 is the slope of the tangent line to f1x2 at f1a2 is the instantaneous rate of change of with respect to at In the special case in which time and 1t2 displacement 1directed dis- tance2 at time of an object traveling in straight line the instantaneous rate of change is called the instantaneous velocity. ,Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Limit (mathematics)|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Mathematics|Dependent and independent variables|Dependent and independent variables|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Point (geometry)|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions|Mathematical proof|Mathematical proof|Mathematical proof|Mathematical proof|Mathematical proof|Slope|Slope|Slope|Slope|Slope|Slope|Slope|Slope|Interval (mathematics)|Sign (mathematics)|Equation|Equation|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Function (mathematics)|Existential quantification|Existential quantification|Displacement (vector)|Position (vector)|Number|Number|Number|Secant line|Secant line|Secant line|Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean|Derivative|Derivative|Derivative|Derivative|Derivative|Derivative|Derivative|Derivative|Derivative|Derivative|Derivative|Derivative|Derivative|Derivative|Derivative|Expression (mathematics)|Curve|Curve|Curve|Curve|Curve|Curve|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Limit of a function|Scientific notation|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)|Line (geometry)
95,95,13.4,Limits at Infinity - Limits of Sequences,865,"Limits at Infinity Limits of Sequences In this section we study special kind of limit called limit at infinity. We examine the limit of function f1x2 as becomes large. We also examine the limit of sequence as becomes large. Limits of sequences will be used in Section 13.5 to help us find the area under the graph of function. Limits at Infinity &1 &2 &3 &4 &5 &10 &50 &100 &1000 x22 ""1.000000 0.000000 0.600000 0.800000 0.882353 0.923077 0.980198 0.999200 0.999800 0.999998 Lets investigate the behavior of the function defined by f1x2 as becomes large. The table in the margin gives values of this function rounded to six decimal places and the graph of has been drawn by computer in Figure 1. As grows larger and larger you can see that the values of 1x2 get closer and closer to 1. In fact it seems that we can make the values of f1x2 as close as we like to by tak- ing sufficiently large. This situation is expressed symbolically by writing lim xSq In general we use the notation lim f1x2 xSq to indicate that the values of f1x2 become closer and closer to as becomes larger and larger. LIMIT AT INFINIT Let be function defined on some interval 1a Then lim f1x2 xSq means that the values of f1x2 can be made arbitrarily close to by taking sufficiently large. Another notation for lim f1x2 is The symbol does not represent number. Nevertheless we often read the expression lim f1x2 as xSq the limit of f1x2 as approaches infinity is or the limit of f1x2 as becomes infinite is or the limit of f1x2 as increases without bound is Geometric illustrations are shown in Figure 2. Notice that there are many ways for the graph of to approach the line (which is called horizontal asymptote) as we look to the far right. Referring back to Figure we see that for numerically large negative values of the values of f1x2 are close to 1. By letting decrease through negative values without bound we can make 1x2 as close as we like to 1. This is expressed by writing lim xS""q The general definition is as follows. LIMIT AT NEGATIVE INFINIT Let be function defined on some interval 1""q a2 Then lim f1x2 xS""q means that the values of f1x2 can be made arbitrarily close to by taking sufficiently large negative. yL Again the symbol ""q does not represent number but the expression lim 1x2 xS""q is often read as yL The definition is illustrated in Figure 3. Notice that the graph approaches the line as we look to the far left. Examples illustrating lim 1x2 xS the limit of f1x2 as approaches negative infinity is HORIZONTAL ASYMPTOTE The line is called horizontal asymptote of the curve f1x2 if For instance the curve illustrated in Figure has the line as horizontal as- ymptote because lim xSq As we discovered in Section 5.5 an example of curve with two horizontal asymp- totes is tan ""1 (see Figure 4). In fact lim tan ""1 xS""q tan ""1 and lim tan ""1 xSq so both of the lines ""p2 and p2 are horizontal asymptotes. (This follows from the fact that the lines &p2 are vertical asymptotes of the graph of tan.) Limits of Sequences FIGURE In Section 12.1 we introduced the idea of sequence of numbers Here we are interested in their behavior as becomes large. For instance the sequence defined by is pictured in Figure by plotting its terms on number line and in Figure 10 by plotting its graph. From Figure or 10 it appears that the terms of the sequence n1n 12 are approaching as becomes large. We indicate this by writing FIGURE lim nSq Limits at Infinity Limits of Sequences 869 DEFINITION OF THE LIMIT OF SEQUENCE sequence has the limit and we write lim nSq FIGURE 10 or as if the nth term of the sequence can be made arbitrarily close to by taking sufficiently large. If lim nSq exists we say the sequence converges (or is con- vergent). Otherwise we say the sequence diverges (or is divergent).
